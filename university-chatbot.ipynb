Making machines think! The international Master’s program in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is based on a solid foundation and education in the field of Computer Science. The program consists of three main pillars: symbolic AI (such as Expert Systems and Logical Calculi), subsymbolic AI (such as Deep and Machine Learning) and AI systems and applications . The degree course offers a broad variety of topics and specializations. The wide range of applications and research groups in the Department of Computer Science provides broad opportunities for “hands-on” project work and practical sessions. In contrast to Data Science oriented programs, AI focuses on the constructive modelling and implementation of algorithms, data structures, neural networks and their respective applications. Degree Master of Science Duration of studies in semester 4 Start of degree program Summer semester, Winter semester Study location Erlangen Number of students 250-600 Subject group Engineering sciences Special ways to study International degree program, Part-time degree program Teaching language completely in English Admission Requirements Qualification assessment Apply now Tips for application Tips for internationals What is the degree program about? The desired goal that is to be achieved by the study of Artificial Intelligence at the Faculty of Engineering is the education of thoroughly skilled computer scientists with a specifically formed profile. Using the methodical skills and knowledge acquired during their education, graduates should be able to solve engineering tasks which are located at any of the intersections of the areas of computer science, applied mathematics, and an engineering discipline independently and responsibly. They should also be able to develop new perspectives on their field of activity and to judge applied tools and methodologies critically. Goals of the Master’s Program Demand Graduates of our Master’s program have excellent job prospects. During your studies, subjects you were first introduced to during your qualifying degree can be given more breadth and depth, according to your individual goals and preferences. Students are introduced to current topics of academic or industrial research. A successfully completed Master’s degree will be acknowledged as a prerequisite for being admitted to doctoral programs at German universities. Actual admission to a doctoral program, however, also requires proof of high research potential, as preferably demonstrated by an outstanding Master’s thesis. International Orientation The program complies with the internationally accepted Bachelor’s-Master’s structure. The majority of the courses are in English, thus making it attractive for foreign students who do not speak German. At the same time, German students in the program benefit from working with English as an international scientific language. That way it also becomes easier for German students to work or study abroad afterwards. The possibility of studying abroad is additionally enhanced by the program’s compatibility with the Anglo-American university system. Flexibility The integration of many different specialized fields requires a flexible organization of study plans. Following the Anglo-American pattern, students are encouraged to choose an individualized study plan from a wide selection of fields to suit their individual interests. The program is modular, as defined by the examination regulations (Prüfungsordnung). In order to ensure optimal support students are assisted by special academic advisors (Studienberater) for the AI program. Design and structure The program encompasses 120 ECTS credits, usually split over four semesters at a rate of 30 ECTS credits per semester. This section will give some further detail. Please also refer to the official study regulations, especially the FPO, and the standard degree program structure. Electives [50 ECTS]: The elective courses in this Master’s program are geared towards introducing students to academic research around artificial intelligence and its methodologies as well as offering every student the opportunity to shape their profile specifically towards their talents and interests. The electives are centered around the three central pillars of the AI Master’s program: Symbolic AI Subsymbolic AI AI Systems and Applications Students will have to take a total of 50 ECTS credits worth of elective courses, with no less than 10 of them in each of the central pillars. Which courses are available for each of these tracks is announced on a semester-by-semester basis in the module catalog. Projects [10 + 10 ECTS]: The two required 10 ECTS projects are intended to hone and put to the test students’ acquired technical knowledge, research ability and self-organization skills. They will typically be completed in the context of a work group related to artificial intelligence and will require the students to independently tackle a more complex problem or question. Both projects have to be associated with one of the central pillars discussed above and cannot both be associated with the same pillar. Each project is planned to take approximately 300 hours over six months. Seminar [5 ECTS]: The seminar will allow students to connect with a topic complex of their choice, conduct research and interact with academic information, and present their findings to a relevant audience. It is intended to account for 5 ECTS credits and can be completed in a group. Minor [15 ECTS]: For this module, students will chose 15 ECTS credits worth of courses that have a practical or topical connection to artificial intelligence (but are not already included in the electives discussed above). The goal is to work on connecting the gained knowledge to a broad array of subjects that interface with artificial intelligence and may form the basis for applications in future employment. Master’s Thesis [30 ECTS]: The Master’s thesis can be registered at the Examinations Office as soon as the student has successfully collected 70 ECTS credits. It has an extent of around 900 hours and has to be completed within six months after registration. The topic of the thesis must be related to subjects studied by the student during the program. A special thesis supervisor is usually assigned to each student. The thesis may involve regular meetings with the thesis supervisor and also participation in a larger research group. It needs to be written in English. An oral presentation of the results lasting about 30 minutes and a consecutive discussion are obligatory. Admission requirements, application, and enrollment Admission requirements (first semester) Qualification assessment Application deadline winter semester 31.05. Application deadline summer semester 30.11. Content-related admission requirements Completion of an excellent Bachelor’s degree or a corresponding qualification in Computer Science, in a related scientific or technical field, or in Mathematics.

Directions FAU is based in two main locations – Erlangen and Nuremberg. There are also some parts of the University which are based in other areas of the region, such as in Fürth. The addresses of the various departments and institutes are available on their websites. Getting to Erlangen Getting to Fürth Getting to Nuremberg Getting to Erlangen No matter where you want to go in Erlangen city centre, everything is close at hand. All of the locations within the city centre are only about 10 minutes away from each other. The best way around the city centre is by foot – or by bike, of course. If you do come by car, we would recommend parking immediately behind the main station in the large station car park known locally as the Großparkplatz. From there, it is only a few minutes to the city centre. Refer to Google Maps or another map service for detailed directions. By train: The main station in Erlangen is virtually in the city centre. The nearest airport is in Nuremberg. From there, the quickest way into Erlangen is by bus (Nuremberg airport to Erlangen Arcaden), or alternatively by train via Nuremberg main station. If you have to go to FAU Campus Erlangen South or the Department of Sport Science and Sport, it is best to get off at the S-Bahn station ‘Erlangen Paul Gossen Straße’. From there, it is just a few stops on the bus to your destination. There are also buses via the north of Nuremberg if you are coming from Nuremberg. Timetables are available from Deutsche Bahn and the local public transport company, VGN . Getting to Fürth You can either take the U-Bahn, the Regionalexpress or the S-Bahn to get from Nuremberg to Fürth. The quickest way to and from Erlangen from Fürth is by Regionalexpress or S-Bahn. If you are travelling from Nuremberg airport, you can get a bus directly to the stop Fürther Rathaus. From there, you can continue your journey on foot, by underground train or by bus, depending on where you want to go. If you are arriving by ICE, change trains at Nuremberg main station and take the Regionalexpress, S-Bahn trains or or underground train to Fürth. Timetables are available from Deutsche Bahn and the local public transport company, VGN . If you are coming by car, the A73 takes you to Fürth. The FAU Fürth campus is very close to the exit Nürnberg/Fürth and has a car park you can use. Getting to Nuremberg The best way to travel around Nuremberg is by public transport. There is an extensive network of trams, underground trains, the S-Bahn trains and buses which cover nearly the whole of Nuremberg. Timetables are available from Deutsche Bahn and the local public transport company, VGN . However, the city centre is also easy to reach from the main station, and cycling is also a good option. Several motorways from the North, South, East and West converge in the city. In Nuremberg itself there are plenty of parking garages and public parking spaces, even in and around the city centre. From the airport, it takes about 20 minutes on the underground train to the city centre. The School of Business, Economics, and Society is spread over two sites in Nuremberg.

Funding provided by the DFG (German Research Foundation) is especially significant, as it is awarded on the basis of particularly strict criteria. Accordingly, the percentage of applications which are successful is relatively low: From 2019 to 2022 the national percentage of applications granted by the DFG in all disciplines was between 26.9 and 36.8 percent. When it comes to DFG funding, FAU has been ranked among the top ten best universities in Germany for many years. For 2022, FAU has been granted 109.2 million euros of DFG funding. Ongoing DFG projects which FAU is currently involved in Collaborative Research Centers at FAU (CRC) Collaborative Research Centers at FAU (CRC) Collaborative Research Centers (CRC) and Transregios (TRR) are research institutions at universities which are awarded long-term funding where researchers work together as part of an interdisciplinary research program. FAU is involved in 19 Collaborative Research Centers or Collaborative Research Centers/Transregios (CRC/TRR) and is the main applicant university for 9 and co-applicant for 6 of these. (updated May 5, 2024) Collaborative Research Centers/Transregios with FAU as the main applicant university CRC 1181 (with integrated research training group) − Checkpoints for resolution of inflammation CRC 1181 (with integrated research training group) − Checkpoints for resolution of inflammation Inflammation is an important repair mechanism that activates the body’s immune cells in order to respond to tissue stress and damage. CRC 1181 aims to gain a better understanding of the molecular processes involved in stopping this immune response after repairs have been completed. This is important as immune cells that are not deactivated continue to act on healthy tissue, leading to chronic inflammation which is manifested as conditions such as asthma or arthritis. Researchers at CRC 1181 are investigating fundamental immune mechanisms, the activation of defense cells, and the relationship between tissue structure and cell death in order to find out why the immune response is not deactivated in the case of chronic inflammation. Professor Georg Schett is speaker for CRC 1181 . The project has received subsequent funding until June 30, 2024. To the website of Collaborative Research Center 1181 CRC 1411 (with integrated research training group) − Product design of disperse systems CRC 1411 (with integrated research training group) − Product design of disperse systems CRC 1411 focuses on optimizing nanoparticle design. For this purpose, particle syntheses are combined with novel separation methods for classifying nanoparticles. The key feature of this approach is that production is optimized in such a way that particles with engineered properties can be produced in continuous processes. These elegant approaches to property and process design replace current methods that are often highly complex and based on experiments. Thanks to this innovation, the new CRC will make important contributions to the digitalization of the product design of particle systems. In 20 individual projects, researchers from the fields of chemical engineering, materials sciences, mathematics and physics will design, produce and characterize new nanoparticles. Designing particles with special optical properties is a central aspect of this research. Within the framework of the CRC, a research training group has been set up for doctoral research in nanoparticle design – a world first. The CRC is also breaking new ground in dealing with the large amounts of data generated in the experiments and simulations. Professor Nicolas Vogel is speaker for CRC 1411 . The project is currently being funded in the second funding period until December 31, 2027. To the website of Collaborative Research Center 1411 Collaborative Research Center 1452 (with integrated Research Training Group) − Catalysis at Liquid Surfaces (CLINT) Collaborative Research Center 1452 (with integrated Research Training Group) − Catalysis at Liquid Surfaces (CLINT) The CRC ‘Catalysis at Liquid Surfaces (CLINT)’ is pursuing a completely new approach in chemical reaction engineering by using the highly-dynamic anisotropic environment of gaseous-liquid and liquid-solid interfaces to create technical catalysts with new properties and as yet unattained productivity, stability and manageability. The aim is to combine the understanding of catalytic processes with targeted material development, which is why the research will include everything from model systems to real catalysts and incorporate in-situ methods. Professor Peter Wasserscheid is speaker for CRC 1452 . The project is currently being funded in the first funding period until December 31, 2024. To the website of Collaborative Research Center 1452 Collaborative Research Center 1483 − Empatho-Kinaesthetic Sensory Systems – EmpkinS Collaborative Research Center 1483 − Empatho-Kinaesthetic Sensory Systems – EmpkinS CRC 1483 EmpkinS (Empatho-Kinaesthetic Sensory Systems) is aimed at finding brand new ‘digital’ patient-centered options for diagnosis and treatment in medicine and psychology by combining touch-free radar, wireless and camera-based sensor technologies with innovative signal processing methods and artificial intelligence. EmpkinS has received roughly 11 million euros of funding for the next four years. In addition to FAU, Hamburg University of Technology, the University of Bayreuth and the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits in Erlangen are also involved in the project. Professor Martin Vossiek is speaker for CRC 1483 . The project is currently being funded in the first funding period until June 30, 2025. To the website of Collaborative Research Center 1483 Collaborative Research Center 1540 − Exploring Brain Mechanics (EBM) Collaborative Research Center 1540 − Exploring Brain Mechanics (EBM) The central nervous system (CNS) is our most complex organ system. Despite tremendous progress in our understanding of the biochemical, electrical, and genetic regulation of CNS functioning and malfunctioning, many fundamental processes and diseases are still not fully understood. Only recently, groups of several PLs in this consortium, and a few other groups worldwide, have discovered an important contribution of mechanical signals to regulating CNS cell function. The CRC 1540 ‘Exploring Brain Mechanics’ will synergise the expertise of engineers, physicists, biologists, medical researchers, and clinicians in Erlangen and Berlin to exploit mechanics-based approaches to advance our understanding of CNS function and, as a long-term vision, to provide the foundation for future improvement of diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders. The speaker of CRC 1540 is Professor Dr.-Ing. habil. Paul Steinmann. The project is currently being funded in the first funding period until December 31, 2026. To the website of Collaborative Research Center 1540 CRC/Transregio 154 (with Research Training Group) − Mathematical modeling, simulation and optimization using the example of gas networks CRC/Transregio 154 (with Research Training Group) − Mathematical modeling, simulation and optimization using the example of gas networks The goal of CRC/Transregio 154 is to meet the challenges of energy reform using mathematical modeling, simulation and optimization in order to provide solutions which set a new quality standard. New knowledge of various fields of mathematics, such as mathematical modeling, numerical analysis and simulation, or integer, continuous and stochastic optimization are required to achieve this. Professor Frauke Liers has been speaker of SFB/Transregio 154 since April 1, 2023. The project is currently being funded in the third funding period until June 30, 2026. To the website of CRC/TR 154 Collaborative Research Center/Transregio 241 (with integrated research training group) ‘Immune-epithelial communication in inflammatory bowel diseases’ Collaborative Research Center/Transregio 241 (with integrated research training group) ‘Immune-epithelial communication in inflammatory bowel diseases’ The aim of CRC/TRR 241 is to better understand the interaction between cells in mucous membranes and immune cells in the bowel and to develop more effective therapy methods for chronic inflammation. During the next few years, researchers will integrate findings about the regulation and function of the immune system in the bowel and current data about anti-microbial defense on the mucous membrane barrier into a new concept. The individual projects will focus in particular on the role of misdirected communication between epithelium and immune cells during the pathogenesis of IBD. The researchers’ long-term aim is to develop medication that targets the causes of bowel inflammation while retaining the ability of the immune system to fight infections and cancer cells. In addition, they hope to find diagnostic methods that predict patients’ response to therapies – a goal that not only serves to relieve symptoms quickly, but should also contribute to lowering treatment costs. Professor Christoph Becker is speaker for CRC/TRR 241 . The project is currently being funded in the second funding period until June 30, 2026. To the website of CRC/TR 241 CRC/Transregio 306 (with research training group) − Quantum cooperativeness of light and matter (QuCoLiMa) CRC/Transregio 306 (with research training group) − Quantum cooperativeness of light and matter (QuCoLiMa) Cooperative behavior is a well-known phenomena, for example in the dynamics of flocks of birds. However, cooperativeness in the field of quantum mechanics has not yet been fully described. The Collaborative Research Center/Transregio “Quantum Cooperativeness of Light and Matter (QuCoLiMa)” investigates cooperativeness on the quantum level. The research group hopes to contribute to a systematic understanding in the long term of the spatial and temporal quantum correlations in mesoscopic systems in which light and matter have very strong interrelationships. Its results could enable quantum cooperativeness to be used in sensors, communication systems and in quantum computing in the future. Professor Joachim von Zanthier is speaker for CRC/TRR 306 . The project is currently being funded in the first funding period until December 31, 2024. To the website of CRC/TR 306 Collaborative Research Center/Transregio 369 − DegeneratIon of bONE induced by inflammation - DIONE Collaborative Research Center/Transregio 369 − DegeneratIon of bONE induced by inflammation - DIONE In Collaborative Research Center/Transregio 369, scientists at FAU are collaborating with colleagues from the Universities of Dresden and Ulm to investigate the connection between chronic inflammation and bone loss or fractures. Although diseases in which the immune system affects the skeletal system, such as osteoporosis, arthritis, or periodontitis, are widespread, this connection has not yet been sufficiently explored. The collaboration in the CRC allows for the integration of new developments in both immunology and bone biology. This includes exploring regulatory circuits within or between cells that control inflammation and skeletal reactions, as well as gaining insights into the metabolism of the immune and skeletal systems. Through these efforts, the teams aim to discover new explanations for how inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, or periodontitis can impact our skeleton. FAU is the coordinating university for the CRC. Professor Aline Bozec is speaker for CRC/Transregio 369 . The project is currently being funded in the first funding period until December 31, 2027. To the website of CRC/TR 369 Collaborative Research Centers/Transregios with FAU as a co-applicant university CRC/Transregio 103 – From atom to turbine blade – scientific foundations for a new generation of monocrystalline superalloys CRC/Transregio 103 – From atom to turbine blade – scientific foundations for a new generation of monocrystalline superalloys Monocrystalline superalloys are key materials in the manufacturing of turbine blades for modern gas turbines, such as those used in space technology and energy production. For this reason, they are as essential for modern society as they are for a sustainable energy supply. Using new monocrystalline technology in gas turbines increases efficiency while reducing harmful emissions – one of the main aspects of research by CRC/TRR 103. Professor Carolin Körner is speaker for Erlangen for CRC/Transregio 103 . The project is currently being funded in the third funding period until December 31, 2026. To the website of CRC/TR 103 CRC/TRR 221 (with Integrated Research Training Group) − Controlling graft-versus-host and graft-versus-leukemia immune reactions after allogenic stem cell transplants CRC/TRR 221 (with Integrated Research Training Group) − Controlling graft-versus-host and graft-versus-leukemia immune reactions after allogenic stem cell transplants Blood stem cell transplants are one treatment option for certain forms of leukemia and lymph node cancer. However, in some patients immunological reactions can occur between the transplanted cells and the healthy tissue after the transplant. This often causes damage to the skin, liver and intestines. CRC/TRR 221 is therefore researching the immunological mechanisms of blood stem cell transplants. The long-term aim is to increase the tolerability of this therapy and to suppress undesirable immune reactions. Professor Andreas Mackensen is speaker for Erlangen for CRC/TRR 221 . The project is currently being funded in the second funding period until December 31, 2025. To the website of CRC/TR 221 CRC/Transregio 225 − From the foundations of biofabrication to functional tissue models CRC/Transregio 225 − From the foundations of biofabrication to functional tissue models This Collaborative Research Center/Transregio is dealing with a new field of research where structures are generated using 3D printing in which cells and materials are arranged in structures similar to tissues. In the long term, this method could be used to create tissue models that could replace animal testing, for example. CRC/TRR 225 is conducting research in the foundations of biofabrication and is investigating the behavior of cells before and after the printing process. In addition, it is seeking to develop new materials and processes for 3D printing of tissue. Professor Aldo R. Boccaccini is speaker for Erlangen for CRC/TRR 225 . The project is currently being funded in the second funding period until December 31, 2025. To the website of CRC/TR 225 CRC/Transregio 285 − Method development for mechanical joinability in versatile process chains CRC/Transregio 285 − Method development for mechanical joinability in versatile process chains In all fields of product manufacturing, such as automotive and mechanical engineering, individual parts are joined to form structures with several connection points. The joinability of parts is the key to efficient production processes. In addition to the need for a prognosis of joinability, the growing number of combinations of materials and geometries means that inflexible mechanical joining processes need to adapt. Up to now, these needed to be tailored to new combinations, which is a complex process. CRC/Transregio “Method development for increasing mechanical joinability in adaptable process chains” will research methods for increasing adaptability in the areas of materials (suitability for joining), construction (joining safety) and manufacturing (joining capability) as well as for joinability prognosis. Professor Marion Merklein is speaker for Erlangen for CRC/Transregio 285 . The project is currently being funded in the second funding period until June 30, 2027. To the website of CRC/TR 285 Collaborative Research Center/Transregio 305 – ‘Striking a moving target: From mechanisms of metastatic organ colonization to novel systemic therapies’ Collaborative Research Center/Transregio 305 – ‘Striking a moving target: From mechanisms of metastatic organ colonization to novel systemic therapies’ The mechanisms behind tumor metastasis are not yet well understood. The Collaborative Research Center/Transregio “Striking a moving target: From mechanisms of metastatic organ colonization to novel systemic therapies” is researching the early phase of organ “colonization” by scattered tumor cells. The research group hopes to increase existing knowledge about the mechanisms of colonization and develop approaches for therapies which could help to stop metastasis at this early stage. Professor Thomas Brabletz is speaker for Erlangen for CRC/TRR 305 . The project is currently being funded in the first funding period until December 31, 2024. To the website of CRC/TR 305 Collaborative Research Center/Transregio 374 – Tubular system and interstitium of the kidney: (Patho-) physiology and crosstalk Collaborative Research Center/Transregio 374 – Tubular system and interstitium of the kidney: (Patho-) physiology and crosstalk In Germany, more than 5 million people suffer from chronic kidney disease, although the majority of them are unaware that they are affected. Around 100,000 of them require renal replacement therapy in the form of dialysis or a transplant. Kidneys’ detoxification and excretory functions are based on two steps: first of all, a large amount of filtrate is formed from blood plasma, before it is largely reabsorbed and modified in a system of tubes, known as the tubules. Until now, research into kidney disease has focused predominantly on the filtration process. The function of the tubules and the surrounding tissue (tubular interstitium) has been largely neglected in spite of its major relevance to disease, as the interactions that take place there are extremely complex and difficult to address using suitable methods. In order to tackle this issue, an interdisciplinary group of researchers has come together in Collaborative Research Center CRC 1350/Transregio TRR 374, focusing on exploring these complex processes within the kidney and the signal pathways of the tubular interstitium. In the first funding period for the CRC 1350 from 2019 to 2022, the team of researchers from the University of Regensburg and Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg gained important insights into how various kidney diseases are triggered. For example, they uncovered mechanisms for inflammatory processes and excessive scarring and identified genetic risk factors for the loss of kidney function. From 2023, Collaborative Research Center 1350 will become Transregio 374. This will allow the team of researchers to link fundamental research, clinical research, cutting-edge technology and data science even better than before, and further synergies can be created between the two complementary kidney centers in Eastern Bavaria, Regensburg and Erlangen. We believe that together with our national and international partners, we are in an ideal position to conduct modern kidney research, to train the kidney researchers and physicians of the future and develop tailored diagnostics and treatments for sufferers of kidney disease. Professor Kerstin Amann is speaker for Erlangen for SFB/Transregio 374 . The project is currently being funded in the second funding period until December 31, 2026 (continuation of CRC 1350). To the website of CRC/TR 374 Collaborative Research Centers/Transregios involving FAU Collaborative Research Center 1265 − Re-figuration of spaces Collaborative Research Center 1265 − Re-figuration of spaces Collaborative Research Center 1265 investigates current processes of the spatial reordering of society as a “re-figuration of spaces”. Conceiving of sociality as an essentially spatial phenomenon, it seeks to develop an empirically-based theory of contemporary social change that views social change as a form of processual, spatial-communicative refiguration. Professor Silke Steets (Institute of Sociology) is the speaker for CRC 1265 in Erlangen. Together with Professor Dr. Hubert Knoblauch (TU Berlin), she is in charge of sub-project B02 “Control/Space: The spatiality of digital infrastructures in contextures, maps and discourses.” The project is currently being funded in the second funding period until December 31, 2025. To the website of Collaborative Research Center 1265 Collaborative Research Center 1270− Electrically Active Implants – ELAINE Collaborative Research Center 1270− Electrically Active Implants – ELAINE European populations are aging rapidly. By the year 2060, every third person living in Germany will be older than 65. For this reason, the social and socio-economic relevance of regenerative therapies is clearly increasing. This holds particularly true for implants: the older the population grows, the more medical implants will be required for various indication areas and the more often they will have to be replaced during the course of therapy. The research vision pursued by the Collaborative Research Center ELAINE focuses on innovative electrically active implants. Specifically, we address implants employed for the regeneration of bone and cartilage, and implants for deep brain stimulation to treat movement disorders. Three central research objectives are a means to implement our research vision. The first objective is to establish innovative energy autonomous implants that allow a feedback-controlled electrical stimulation. Thus, we will pave the way for new long-time medical applications, and individual patient treatment by conceiving an ultra-low power, miniaturized implant electronic platform supporting all electrically active implants being considered in ELAINE. A second objective is to derive efficient multi-scale simulation models to enable rapid progress in targeted implant improvements and patient-specific therapies. Here, new methods in the simulation of biomaterial compounds, electromagnetic stimulus of living cells and the validation of results will push the fundamental understanding in ELAINE far beyond the state of the art. The third long-term objective is to analyze the basic mechanisms of electrical stimulation in bone, cartilage and brain, and to translate this knowledge into clinical practice. The technical vision focuses on an energy-minimized electrical stimulator that works autonomously for 12 weeks, is fully programmable and implantable with continuous and intermittent modes for application both in humans and in animals. For this purpose, scientists from the fields of electrical engineering, computer science, mechanical engineering, material science, physics, biology, and medicine will work together in an interdisciplinary manner. As a unique characteristic, our interdisciplinary consortium enables a scientifically sound validation of newly derived theoretical models, computational methods and technical solutions through experiments in both engineering and the life sciences. This high-risk collaborative and interdisciplinary research program is designed to demonstrate new approaches for future biomedical implants, hopefully increasing the chances of overcoming the above-mentioned health problems of aging populations. Professor Aldo R. Boccaccini is speaker for Erlangen for CRC 1270 . The project is currently being funded in the second funding period until June 30, 2025. To the website of Collaborative Research Center 1270 Collaborative Research Center 1278 − Polymer-based nanoparticle libraries for targeted anti-inflammatory strategies Collaborative Research Center 1278 − Polymer-based nanoparticle libraries for targeted anti-inflammatory strategies The aim of the POLYTARGET CRC is to develop polymer-based nanoparticle carrier materials for the targeted application of pharmaceutical substances. The focus lies on systems that are suitable for treating diseases and syndromes whose morbidity rates are significantly characterized by an inflammatory reaction. The research will involve investigating the relationship between the structure and properties of polymers and nanoparticles and their biological effects with the aid of systematic particle libraries. New functional polymers are being developed for the nanoparticles such as polyesteramides, polyketals, functionalized polysaccharides and cationic polymers that are tailored to the anti-inflammatory substance (both new and known substances) to be incorporated and the desired type of substance release (CORE projects). To increase the circulation time in the body and minimize undesirable interactions with proteins, the nanoparticles can be equipped with polymers known as ‘stealth polymers’ such as poly(ethylenoxide) and poly(2-oxazolin)e. Cell specificity is achieved by active or passive targeting, whereby the coupling of antibodies, peptides or other molecules with specific recognition structures plays a major role. Suitable dyes are included in the carrier materials or covalently attached to enable diagnostic approaches (SHELL projects). In particular within the MEDIUM projects, the nanoparticles are investigated in detail with respect to their physical and chemical properties as well as their biological / pharmaceutical suitability, also taking into account physiological conditions, in in vitro and in vivo models. For this purpose, already established techniques are used, but new methods are also being developed to identify formulations suitable for use in nanomedicines over the long term. Close cooperation within the multi- and interdisciplinary consortium with researchers from chemistry, materials science, biology, pharmacy and medicine offers unique prerequisites for transferring the findings from basic research into applications. Professor Dagmar Fischer is the speaker for Erlangen for CRC 1278 . The project is currently being funded in the second funding period until June 30, 2025. To the website of Collaborative Research Center 1278 Collaborative Research Center 1526 − Pathomechanisms of antibody-mediated autoimmunity – Insights from pemphigoid diseases – PANTAU Collaborative Research Center 1526 − Pathomechanisms of antibody-mediated autoimmunity – Insights from pemphigoid diseases – PANTAU Approximately eight percent of people living in industrial countries suffer from autoimmune diseases. These are triggered when a number of genetic and non-genetic factors combine to make the body mistakenly attack its own structures. Pemphigoid diseases are autoimmune diseases that damage the skin and mucous membranes. In spite of becoming increasingly prevalent in our aging society, they are among the least extensively researched autoimmune diseases across the globe. Collaborative Research Center (CRC) Pathomechanisms of antibody-mediated autoimmunity (PANTAU) – Insights from pemphigoid diseases’ focuses on pemphigoid diseases as a model for antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases. The researchers hope to decipher the mechanisms triggering the disease and pave the way to new approaches for diagnosis and treatment. The working groups led by Prof. Dr. Anja Lux and Prof. Dr. Falk Nimmerjahn from the Chair of Genetics at FAU are involved in CRC 1526 – Insights from pemphigoid diseases at the University of Lübeck. Researchers from FAU are investigating which mechanisms cause auto-antibodies to trigger serious inflammatory reactions in the skin that can in the worst case cause chronic blistering and make the skin peel. The long-term goal of the research is to develop new, targeted treatments for these pemphigoid skin disorders aimed at either preventing or at least reducing these severe inflammatory processes. The speaker for Erlangen for CRC 1526 is Professor Falk Nimmerjahn. The project is currently being funded in the first funding period until December 31, 2025. To the website of Collaborative Research Center 1526 Research training groups at FAU (RTG) Research training groups at FAU (RTG) Research training groups (RTG) support young researchers. They give doctoral candidates the opportunity to carry out their work within the framework of a coordinated research program supported by senior researchers and professors. FAU is involved in 16 research training groups (and is the applicant university for 12 of these) and in 9 Integrated research training groups. (updated May 10, 2024) Research training groups with FAU as the main applicant university RTG 2162 − Neurodevelopment and vulnerability of the central nervous system RTG 2162 − Neurodevelopment and vulnerability of the central nervous system How is the development of the central nervous system (CNS) related to the occurrence of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases in late adulthood? To what extent do development processes influence resistance to CNS diseases in adulthood? What are the most important factors here? These are just some of the fundamental questions that the doctoral candidates in RTG 2162 are investigating using methods such as animal models and induced pluripotent stem cells developed from patients’ cells.

At the same time, there are also new opportunities for criminal prosecution, such as automated online data collection and analysis, and monitoring programs. However, what impact does it have on the basic rights of those affected when ‘forensic computing’ is used? The research training group “Cybercrime and forensic computing” brings together experts from the fields of computer science and law to systematically investigate the research area of “criminal prosecution of cybercrime”. Professor Felix Freiling is speaker for RTG 2475 . The project is currently being funded in the second funding period until September 30, 2028. To the website of Research Training Group 2475 International Research Training Group 2495 − Energy conversion systems: From materials to devices International Research Training Group 2495 − Energy conversion systems: From materials to devices The objective of this international research training group is to research electro-mechanical (piezo-electric) and electro-optical (photovoltaic and water splitting) energy conversion systems that are based on lead-free perovskite materials. The development of lead-free materials systems is a pioneering field of research due to international regulations that prohibit the use of heavy metals in electronic devices, for example. This affects the use of lead-free materials not only in renewable energy but also in high-tech applications such as autonomous wireless sensors. Research into multiscale phenomena during, for example, energy conversion, development and use of lead-free perovskite materials in new 2D and 3D processing technology, and in device integration is of particular interest. This involves the use of various synthesis, manufacturing and characterizing techniques that are coupled with simulations. Scale-specific phenomena can now be investigated in a collaborative research and training environment thanks solely to this interdisciplinary research team and its combined expertise in the various length scales. The partners in this international research training group will enjoy access to a wide variety of experimental techniques and measuring devices and be able to enter into contact with partners in industry in Japan.

To the website of Research Training Group 2495 RTG 2504 – Novel antiviral approaches from small molecules to immune intervention RTG 2504 – Novel antiviral approaches from small molecules to immune intervention The objective of this research training group is to develop new strategies for treating and preventing viral diseases by identifying cellular points of attack for antiviral treatments and inserting them into the immune system, preventing the development of resistant viruses. A particular focus is placed on training young researchers who are familiar both with antiviral chemotherapy and immune-based approaches. The doctoral candidates will receive training from medical researchers, biologists, pharmacists and bioinformatics specialists at FAU. Cooperation with the Ragon Institute in Boston, USA, a research institute set up by the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard University, will open up international perspectives for the researchers. Professor Klaus Überla is speaker for RTG 2504 . The project is currently being funded in the first funding period until March 31, 2024. To the website of Research Training Group 2504 Research Training Group 2599 − FAIR - Fine-Tuners of the Adaptive Immune Response Research Training Group 2599 − FAIR - Fine-Tuners of the Adaptive Immune Response The goal of the proposed Research Training Group is to establish an internationally competitive research and training program to promote young scientists and medical students in the field of immunology. The analysis of defined molecular regulators using genome-wide transcriptome analysis, modern imaging techniques, transgenic mouse technologies and CRISPR-mediated genome editing will identify and characterize new fine-tuners of adaptive immune responses and immune memory. To reach our goal, we have recruited five female and 12 male researchers with an internationally recognized expertise in the field of adaptive immunity from eight institutes and clinical departments at the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU). All researchers are supported by third-party funding and experienced in graduate training. We also offer an innovative training program for Dr. rer. nat. candidates with a master’s degree in life sciences. This program consists of a bi-weekly RTG Paul-Ehrlich-Club, research-specific as well as interdisciplinary hard skill and soft skill workshops, internal RTG research retreats and RTG network meetings, the RTG guest speaker series, and the RTG’s public relation program. Furthermore, we have developed a fast-track program that will lead six fellows with a bachelor’s degree to the Dr. rer. nat. degree without the need to obtain a master’s degree. During their one-year qualification phase, the fast-track candidates will be prepare for their dissertation phase and receive extensive training in molecular biology and immunology within the Master’s program “Integrated Immunology,” attend RTG-specific events, and participate in a research-oriented rotation in a laboratory outside of Germany. To motivate medical students for basic research, we will set up an innovative and structured 18-month-long doctoral program. Highlights of this program are an 8-month lab phase and a curriculum tailored to the educational needs of each medical student. A three-member thesis advisory committee will mentor all doctoral candidates through-out their entire thesis project. To internationally position our doctoral candidates, they will organize the 7th International RTG Symposium on “Regulators of Adaptive Immunity” and do research rotations in laboratories outside of Germany. We are convinced that our innovative training and research concept with hypothesis-driven projects will better prepare our doctoral candidates for a professional post-graduate career as an immunologist and help them to develop into critically thinking scientists, to complete their thesis in 3-4 years, and to build an international network. Professor Hans-Martin Jäck is speaker for RTG 2599 . The project is currently being funded in the first funding period until June 30, 2025. To the website of Research Training Group 2599 Research Training Group 2740 − Microenvironmental, Metabolic and Microbial Signals Regulating Immune Cell-Pathogen Interactions - ImmunoMicroTope Research Training Group 2740 − Microenvironmental, Metabolic and Microbial Signals Regulating Immune Cell-Pathogen Interactions - ImmunoMicroTope The German Research Foundation (DFG) is funding a new Research Training Group from January 2022 for an initial period of four and a half years at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) and Universitätsklinikum Erlangen that is investigating which microenvironmental factors in tissue are significant for antimicrobial defense and the survival of pathogens. Why does the immune system successfully fight many infections caused by bacteria, fungi or parasites, but not other infections? Which role do the individual cells of the immune system play in the interaction with the microenvironment in tissue, the milieu factors and the metabolism of the infected cells and the pathogens? How does this “immune microtope” differ with various infectious diseases? During the next four and a half years, the answers to these questions will be sought in 14 doctoral research projects in the new RTG 2740 “Immunomicrotope: Microenvironmental, metabolic and microbial signals regulating immune cell-pathogen interactions” funded by the DFG. RTG 2740 provides an interface between infection biology, immunology, bioinformatics and mathematics. The latest methods in high-resolution imaging, metabolomic analyses, bioinformatics and mathematical model generation will be used. During the structured training program, the 14 doctoral candidates will receive training in various seminars and courses and will be given the opportunity to take part in a stay abroad at a renowned laboratory. A series of guest lectures with international top-level researchers, an annual closed-door conference, and a bi-annual international symposium round out the training provided to the young researchers in the field of infection immunology and molecular microbiology for future positions in leading national and international research institutions. GRK 2740 “Immunomicrotope” is initially being funded by the DFG with 6.1 million euros for four and a half years which may be extended by a further four and a half years on positive evaluation. In addition to 7 different institutes and chairs at Universitätsklinikum Erlangen and FAU, Universitätsklinikum Regensburg also has its own project in the consortium. Prof. Dr. Christian Bogdan, Chair of Microbiology and Immunology of Infection at FAU and Director of the Institute of Microbiology – Clinical Microbiology, Immunology and Hygiene at Universitätsklinikum Erlangen is speaker of the consortium and responsible for coordinating the project in conjunction with Dr. Ilka Knippertz. Applications from candidates with a Master’s degree can now be submitted. Professor Christian Bogdan is speaker for RTG 2740 . The project is being funded from January 1, 2022 until June 30, 2026. To the website of Research Training Group 2740 Research Training Group 2726 – The sentimental in literature, culture and politics Research Training Group 2726 – The sentimental in literature, culture and politics The Research Training Group “The sentimental in literature, culture and politics” investigates forms and functions of the sentimental from synchronic and diachronic perspectives. We understand the sentimental as a communicative code for forming relationships capable of referring back to emotional knowledge and activating empathic skills. It can be observed in various fields of symbolic interaction, such as aesthetic-literary, mediatized, staged and political-rhetorical areas of application and can be described as an element of socially effective discourse and practices. From a perspective based on the comparison of cultures, the training group focuses on cultural-specific uses and on intercultural and transcultural and appropriation processes involving this code in national and transnational contexts. The sentimental comes into play as an aesthetic form of presentation serving specific affective economies or a sociopolitical interpellation strategy in literary and non-literary narratives as a means of collective crisis management and endowing sense to affective, community-building cultural practices and as a strategy for political mobilization and moral legitimation, e.g. in protest movements or populist rhetoric. The research training group aims to analyze how this code develops its efficacy in the intertwining of allegedly private emotional worlds and the public display thereof and how it is exploited in various situations for various intentions. The issues investigated by the research training group are of the utmost relevance in today’s world, indicated in the often mentioned crisis in political communication and its new emotive character (not only) in Western democracies and underlined by the long history of using a sentimental register to generate empathy and solidarity in light of individual and collective suffering. The aim of our work is to systematically link the various discourses on the sentimental in literature and cultural studies as well as sociology and politics, some of which have until now only focused on one specific discipline or only been touched upon in passing. The research program is linked to an innovative and demanding qualification and training concept characterized by the integration of interdisciplinary research-oriented training and practical measures. Together with tried and tested formats such as a colloquium where postdoctoral and doctoral candidates can present their projects, guest lectures and interdisciplinary method workshops, the research training group offers a practical module (financed with FAU funds) in which doctoral candidates can gain an insight into other extramural fields. The research training group has grown out of many years of interdisciplinary collaboration between the involved researchers and belongs to a research environment that links specific cultural expertise with theoretical reflection on fundamental issues.

To the website of Research Training Group 2726 Research Training Group 2806 − Literature and the public sphere in different contemporary cultures Research Training Group 2806 − Literature and the public sphere in different contemporary cultures Under which social, political, economic and medial conditions is literature created? And how does literature affect its surrounding environments? The RTG “Literature and the public sphere in different contemporary cultures” will be examining these questions during its research. It will be looking at contemporary literature in different languages and cultural spaces since 1945 in view of changing and fragmenting public spheres. This is characterized in particular by the praxeological concept of literature, which includes socio-cultural contexts, political frameworks, institutional arrangements, the literature industry and the literary scene into the analysis. The speakers are Prof. Dr. Dirk Niefanger, Chair of Modern German Literature with a Systematic Focus, and Prof. Dr. Antje Kley, Chair of American Literary Studies.

This involves using molecules as information carriers in order to communicate in environments and with objects or organisms that are not suitable for conventional communications systems based on electromagnetic waves. The group is led by Professors Castiglione and Schober and develops new theoretical and experimental concepts for molecular communications systems. To do so, researchers investigate how to control bioprocesses and magnetic nanoparticles in blood vessels and molecular communication based on what are known as odorous objects. Professor Robert Schober is speaker for RTG 2950 . The project is currently being funded in the first funding period until May 31, 2029. To the website of the Research Training Group 2950 Integrated Research Training Group for CRC 1181 ‘Checkpoints for resolution of inflammation’ Integrated Research Training Group for CRC 1181 ‘Checkpoints for resolution of inflammation’ Inflammation is the key response strategy of the body to react to tissue stress and damage. The activation of the immune system related to inflammatory reaction needs closer attention. In this context particular importance is attached to the molecular checkpoints, which are responsible for stopping inflammatory reaction in time and finally for its resolution. In fact, there is still very limited knowledge on the mechanisms of resolution, however they are of central relevance for pathogenesis and therapy of chronic inflammatory diseases. Internal diseases in humans of the joints (arthritis), gut (colitis) and lung (asthma), are characterized by chronification of inflammatory reaction. The Collaborative Research Center ‘Checkpoints for resolution of inflammation’ aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms which cause the chronification or resolution of inflammation. The CRC 1181 initiative is a collaboration between the Faculty of Sciences and the Faculty of Medicine at the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Universitätsklinikum Erlangen and the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light in Erlangen. It includes 19 research projects which aim to investigate the molecular checkpoints which cause the chronification or resolution of inflammation as well as innovative instruments for equal opportunities, the promotion of young researchers and networking. Professor Georg Schett is speaker for CRC 1181 . The project has received subsequent funding until June 30, 2024.

To the website of CRC 1483 Integrated Research Training Group as part of CRC 1540 − Exploring Brain Mechanics - EBM Integrated Research Training Group as part of CRC 1540 − Exploring Brain Mechanics - EBM The central nervous system (CNS) is our most complex organ system. Despite tremendous progress in our understanding of the biochemical, electrical, and genetic regulation of CNS functioning and malfunctioning, many fundamental processes and diseases are still not fully understood. Only recently, groups of several PLs in this consortium, and a few other groups worldwide, have discovered an important contribution of mechanical signals to regulating CNS cell function. The CRC 1540 ‘Exploring Brain Mechanics’ will synergise the expertise of engineers, physicists, biologists, medical researchers, and clinicians in Erlangen and Berlin to exploit mechanics-based approaches to advance our understanding of CNS function and, as a long-term vision, to provide the foundation for future improvement of diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders. The speaker of CRC 1540 is Professor Dr.-Ing. habil. Paul Steinmann. The project is currently being funded in the first funding period until December 31, 2026. To the website of CRC 1540 Integrated Research Training Group as part of CRC/Transregio 154 − Mathematical modeling, simulation and optimization using the example of gas networks Integrated Research Training Group as part of CRC/Transregio 154 − Mathematical modeling, simulation and optimization using the example of gas networks Gas will play an important role as an energy source during the energy reform that is due to take place in the coming decades as Germany moves away from nuclear energy in favor of more environmentally-friendly energy sources. There is sufficient gas available and it can be easily sourced and stored. However, ensuring efficient gas supply involves dealing with issues related to transport, network technology, market regulations and using gas in conjunction with other energy sources. The goal of CRC/Transregio 154 is to meet these challenges using mathematical modeling, simulation and optimization in order to provide solutions which set a new quality standard. New knowledge of various fields of mathematics, such as mathematical modeling, numerical analysis and simulation, or integer, continuous and stochastic optimization are required to achieve this. Professor Frauke Liers has been speaker of SFB/Transregio 154 since April 1, 2023. The project is currently being funded in the third funding period until June 30, 2026. To the website of CRC/TR 154 Integrated Research Training Group for CRC/TR 241– Immune-epithelial communication in inflammatory bowel diseases Integrated Research Training Group for CRC/TR 241– Immune-epithelial communication in inflammatory bowel diseases The aim of CRC/TRR 241 is to better understand the interaction between cells in mucous membranes and immune cells in the bowel and to develop more effective therapy methods for chronic inflammation. During the next few years, researchers will integrate findings about the regulation and function of the immune system in the bowel and current data about anti-microbial defense on the mucous membrane barrier into a new concept. The individual projects will focus in particular on the role of misdirected communication between epithelium and immune cells during the pathogenesis of IBD. The researchers’ long-term aim is to develop medication that targets the causes of bowel inflammation while retaining the ability of the immune system to fight infections and cancer cells. In addition, they hope to find diagnostic methods that predict patients’ response to therapies – a goal that not only serves to relieve symptoms quickly, but should also contribute to lowering treatment costs.

However, cooperativeness in the field of quantum mechanics has not yet been fully described. The Collaborative Research Center/Transregio “Quantum Cooperativeness of Light and Matter (QuCoLiMa)” investigates cooperativeness on the quantum level. The research group hopes to contribute to a systematic understanding in the long term of the spatial and temporal quantum correlations in mesoscopic systems in which light and matter have very strong interrelationships. Its results could enable quantum cooperativeness to be used in sensors, communication systems and in quantum computing in the future. Professor Joachim von Zanthier is speaker for CRC/TR 306.

To the website of CRC/TR 306 Research training groups with FAU as the co-applicant university Research Training Group RTG 2680 − Cooperative aperture synthesis for tomographic radar imaging (KoRaTo) Research Training Group RTG 2680 − Cooperative aperture synthesis for tomographic radar imaging (KoRaTo) The aim of the KoRaTo research training group is to train and support young researchers in the new field of cooperative aperture synthesis for recording fundamental geophysical parameters in the biosphere, geosphere, cryosphere and hydrosphere. Cooperative aperture synthesis is the name given to tomographic radar imaging methods that allow large volume or large surface coherent radar apertures to be synthesized by means of cooperation between a large number of individual, mobile non-coherent sub-radar apertures distributed in the 3D space. The sub-radar apertures are created using mobile drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Research is to be carried out in the following areas: 1) Methods for coherently coupling the non-coherent sub-radar apertures in time and space; 2) Optimized time-variant apertures as well as the associated sub-apertures and trajectories of movement; 3) Tomographic imaging methods in non-homogeneous media, facilitated by cooperative spatial aperture synthesis; 4) Concepts for storing, transferring and processing data based on compressed sensing methods and resource optimization for the sensor data of cooperative aperture synthesis. The planned approach to aperture synthesis, which is being researched for the very first time, facilitates new tomographic radar imaging principles. In terms of resolution and information content when observing Earth, it promises to provide completely new standards in radar remote sensing in the geosciences, for example for mapping dynamic processes in the cryosphere, geosphere and biosphere. One example is the ability to locate and record structures correctly and three-dimensionally from several perspectives that are not or only partially visible in non-homogeneous media. Professor Martin Vossiek is speaker for Erlangen for RTG 2680 . The project is currently being funded in the first funding period until June 30, 2026. To the website of Research Training Group 2680 Research Training Group RTG 2861 – Planar carbon lattices (PCL) Research Training Group RTG 2861 – Planar carbon lattices (PCL) – Funding starts on April 1, 2023 With RTG 2861, the universities of TU Dresden and FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg are launching a joint initiative for giving researchers comprehensive training in the relatively new but rapidly developing area of planar carbon lattices (PCL). This new class of materials are atomically precisely ordered materials whose basal plane forms a 1D or 2D lattice, for example graphene nanoribbons or 2D polymers. PCLs combine the chemical variety of planar molecular building blocks with the structural diversity of 2D lattices, making it possible to produce materials with virtually any properties from carbon, without using toxic, rare or noble elements. Thomas Heine, Professorship for Theoretical Chemistry at TU Dresden and speaker of the RTG, explains: “The RTG benefits from the complementary infrastructure and expertise of the two locations TUD and FAU. We are creating a unique combination of synthetic chemistry, condensed matter physics and materials science and hope to research and synthesize new PCLs using experimental and theoretical methods. In future, these could be used in quantum materials, as well as optoelectronic or electrochemical devices of the next generation.” The rapid development and interdisciplinary nature of the subject area means that until now there has not yet been a standard concept for research-based training in PCLs. The RTG aims to establish this required standard with an interdisciplinary research and qualification program combining chemistry, physics and material sciences. Janina Maultzsch, professor of experimental physics at FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg, is the deputy speaker of RTG 2861. She describes the training concept as follows: “We will develop open-access online lectures and tutorials for beginners and advanced students and intend publishing an open-access textbook on PCLs. Research and training at two locations will be facilitated by a virtual research environment combining digital teaching with online tools for exchanging information and research data.” Another important component of the RTG are comprehensive diversity measures, aimed at achieving an equal balance of women and men among the doctoral candidates as well as encouraging young talents from developing countries. “I am particularly pleased about the level of commitment demonstrated by FAU and TUD, each of which are providing a preparatory scholarship for students from developing countries. In conjunction with our open science program, we hope to enable international talents to venture into cutting-edge science,” explains speaker Thomas Heine. Professor Dr. Janina Maultzsch is the speaker for Erlangen for RTG 2861 . The project will be funded in the first funding period until March 31, 2028.

However, in some patients immunological reactions can occur between the transplanted cells and the healthy tissue after the transplant. This often causes damage to the skin, liver and intestines. CRC/TRR 221 is therefore researching the immunological mechanisms of blood stem cell transplants. The long-term aim is to increase the tolerability of this therapy and to suppress undesirable immune reactions. Professor Andreas Mackensen is speaker for Erlangen for CRC/TRR 221 .

Exchange, differentiation and reception Research Training Group 2304 – Byzantium and the Euro-Mediterranean cultures of war. Exchange, differentiation and reception Wars both within countries and beyond their borders have a significant impact on the development of societies. The Byzantine Empire was in constant exchange and conflict with its neighbors and rivals due to its geographic position. This gave rise to a wide range of violent conflicts in the Latin, Slavic and Islamic worlds, and, as a consequence, a diverse range of interrelationships between these war cultures, which we define as the norms, interpretations, attributions of meaning, and reflections related to war as well as its forms and practices. The purpose of this research training group is to analyze Euro-Mediterranean cultures of war and the importance of Byzantium for them in a transcultural perspective for the first time.

We at FAU therefore strive to generate knowledge to shape the future responsibly and openly share knowledge with all stakeholders in society to drive prosperity and create value, as well as using knowledge to improve our world for future generations. The FAU Development plan consolidates this objective. The detailed FAU Development plan “Moving Knowledge” consolidates this objective for our internal stakeholders. In the current abbreviated version of the FAU Development plan (in German) we also offer external interested parties the option of finding out more about the future development of FAU. Sustainability is firmly anchored at FAU as a cross-sectional task. Strategy #FAU2025 #FAU2025 describes the framework, priorities and process of how we going to develop FAU together and prepare for the future. It enables us to take stock of the strategy process up to now and consolidates the most important current developments. Above all, #FAU2025 calls on each and every one of us to shape the future of our FAU in such a way that we use opportunities, release potential for synergies, and shape the University’s unique profile while still focusing on FAU as the ‘bigger picture’. Expand All Moving knowledge – What guides us? Moving knowledge – What guides us? FAU’s motto ‘Moving knowledge’ is an inspiration to many – sometimes fundamentally and generally, sometimes in very specific measures and methods and often motivationally or metaphorically. Whether implicitly or explicitly, FAU’s principles: ‘Innovation – Diversity – Passion’ , provide guidance for our actions in many ways. They remind us of our strengths and everything that connects us as members to our University. They also urge us to orient everything we do and every decision we take even more clearly towards these principles. Since 2017, the four strategic fields of action ‘PEOPLE – EDUCATION – RESEARCH – OUTREACH’ have been defining the central priorities of the University’s future development and providing a framework for its members to develop and achieve their own personal goals. These fields of action provide a guide and help each and every member of the University to play an active role at FAU. Future development – Which priorities are we setting? Future development – Which priorities are we setting? FAU places a clear focus on utilising opportunities in its strategic fields of action: PEOPLE – EDUCATION – RESEARCH – OUTREACH . They structure the priorities for future development. Utilising opportunities means that each and every individual in research and administration must proactively identify and seize opportunities, and contribute to success. PEOPLE : represents the opportunities for career and network development, not only for students, but also for all employees for whom we are responsible. It also represents the opportunity to develop our FAU family as a responsible community. #FAUwelcome , the onboarding programme for newly-appointed professors, is a great example of this responsibility. EDUCATION : represents the opportunity for teaching and learning innovation, learning in interaction, learning from each other at work, learning beyond departmental boundaries, faculties, degree programmes, or teams, learning with partners and partner organisations or the development and utilisation of new learning formats and methods. #FAUdigital delivers the ability to innovate throughout. RESEARCH : represents opportunities for identifying fascinating areas of research and implementing them in research networks, attracting outstanding researchers for our FAU, developing exciting research agendas and providing advice and support to funding providers and helping to shape policy for science and innovation. #FAUconnect makes this potential for development tangible and provides a well-structured framework. OUTREACH : represents the opportunities we have for patenting and licensing intellectual property, opportunities for innovation in education and training, opportunities for involving a wide range of stakeholders in research and innovation, opportunities for exciting science-based start-ups or opportunities for constructive input in the scientific, economic and social ecosystem of innovation that surrounds us. #FAUinnovate consolidates platforms and initiatives here.

Eine (kurze) Geschichte der Fakultäten Handover of keys to the Himbeerpalast (Image: Siemens AG) Bavarian Minister President Dr. Markus Söder: Today, the cabinet has passed historic resolutions underlining the importance of Nuremberg and Erlangen not only as home to a leading university but also as an important location for science and research. … The move to new premises marks a significant change in the structure of Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg. … This is a decisive signal that will have a major impact in Bavaria and beyond! 100 years of the School of Business, Economics and Society image: FAU/Giulia Iannicelli The School of Business, Economics and Society can be traced back to the Nuremberg Commercial College which had just 180 students when it opened in Findelgasse 7, in the centre of Nuremberg, in 1919. A lot has happened since then. Today, the School of Business, Economics and Society is part of FAU with more than 6,000 students and a strong reputation in research. www.wiso100.fau.de Opening of Zollhof 7 In 2017, FAU launched ZOLLHOF, the digital start-up centre for Middle Franconia, together with a number of strong partners. The centre provides national and international start-ups with a launching pad for their innovative ideas. This year, the start-up centre is due to move into its new premises in ZOLLHOF 7, the new home for Germany’s digital hub in Franconia. www.zollhof.de A new home! It is 2028 and the long-awaited event is finally upon us – the Faculty of Humanities, Social Sciences, and Theology is moving into the Humanities Centre in the Himbeerpalast in Erlangen, as planned by the State Ministry. Originally the Siemens headquarters in Erlangen, the buildings with their distinctive red facade are now home to seminar rooms, libraries, offices, lecture halls, cafeterias, advisory centres – and that is not all. The Humanities Centre offers students and scholars an inspiring academic environment together with cutting-edge facilities for studying and research, where innovation, diversity and passion come to life in line with the guiding principles of FAU and to the benefit of Erlangen as a location for research. Promoting internationalisation Internationalisation has long been a priority at FAU. 15 years ago, FAU successfully participated in the ‘Internationalisation of Universities’ Audit organised by the German Rectors’ Conference (HRK) and has completed the reauditing process several times since. The significance of internationalisation at FAU is also underlined by the fact that more Bachelor’s degree programmes are now offered in English and that numbers of international students have grown steadily over the years. Nearly 20 years ago, Vahid Sandoghdar was the first Alexander-von-Humboldt professor at FAU. Several more have since followed in his footsteps. It is also 12 years since we started to take a new approach towards networking with international alumni, commencing with an FAU alumni get-together in Vancouver. Innovator #1 Unfortunately, your browser does not support HTML5 video formats. FAU - Outreach It is now twenty years since FAU was voted the most innovative university in Germany in the Reuters Top 100 Ranking. Since then, FAU has systematically continued to develop its role as an innovator in the regional ecosystem, at a national level and in the international market for innovation. Innovators at FAU know that whilst rankings may set the benchmark, the true measure of success is how successfully innovative ideas are put into practice with strong partners in research, industry and society as a whole. This is what drives research at FAU. 75 years of the Faculty of Engineering Approximately 1500 visitors flooded to the southern campus for the open day held in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Faculty of Engineering, where they enjoyed the wide range of presentations, exhibitions and tours on offer. (Image: Erich Malter) Happy birthday! The Faculty of Engineering is 75 today. Compared to the other faculties, it may still be a youngster, but even at the age of 50 it had accumulated an impressive track record. ‘Thanks to its project initiatives, the Faculty of Engineering sets the standard on an international scale,’ said Science Minister Dr. Ludwig Spaenle at the 50th anniversary celebrations. ‘Its compact structure has definitely also had a role to play in its success. The fact that core engineering subjects are all able to cooperate within one faculty is one special feature of this Faculty.’ Thanks in no small measure to this unusual structure, the Faculty even managed to win four Leibniz awards before its 50th anniversary. 300 years of FAU FAU was established 300 years ago. That is worth celebrating! An extensive and varied anniversary programme reflects the passion for research, teaching and learning which reigns at FAU, leading to a constant stream of innovative ideas. Here’s to the next 300 years of knowledge in motion! Innovation goes hand in hand with tradition Unfortunately, your browser does not support HTML5 video formats.

Everything is new, and you are sure to have a lot of questions, for example, which classes do I have to attend? How do I create a schedule? And where is the university library? Don’t worry, there is an answer to all your questions. Here we have some valuable tips for starting out at university. Be sure to read your e-mails from the University! They give you details about examination dates or pass on important information from the Executive Board. It may make sense to redirect your e-mail to an account you check regularly. Your first steps as a new student at FAU The first thing you have to do as a new student at FAU is to create a schedule , register for classes and attend introductory events . We will guide you through the process step by step. One more important tip for starting out: The order of the individual steps at your faculty may be different from that outlined here. For example, students in their first semester at the Faculty of Engineering first attend introductory sessions and then draw up their schedule. Getting off to a flying start The following tiles take you directly to the tips for new students. Schedule (campo) Creating your schedule Classes (StudOn) Registering for classes Introductory events Overview of events. How to create your schedule Which classes do I have to choose? Which classes do I have to choose? Check your degree program and examination regulations Please refer to your degree program and examination regulations or the module handbook for your degree program to find out which seminars, courses, lectures etc. you have to attend. Select the version of the degree program and examination regulations applicable to you. When starting your first subject semester, this is normally the latest version, which is listed at the very top of the list under “consolidated versions”. If you are unsure: The correct version of the examination regulations is available under the relevant subject on campo by going to the “ Student service ” page and selecting “ My degree programs ”. Grundlagen- und Orientierungsprüfung (GOP) When selecting classes, please pay special attention to which modules you have to complete for the Grundlagen- und Orientierungsprüfung (GOP) . This is not an additional examination. It consists of individual examination achievements from several modules completed during the program. You are required to complete modules accounting for a certain number of ECTS credits by the end of the third semester at the latest. The number of ECTS credits varies according to faculty. The degree program and examination regulations stipulate which modules have to be completed for the GOP. Please note: In many cases it is only possible to repeat examinations relevant to or necessary for the GOP one time. Degree program structure The degree program structures are included as appendices to degree program and examination regulations and are extremely useful. You can use them to check the names of the teaching units included in a module how many and which teaching units belong to a module which semester they should be taken in. This helps you to select the correct teaching units from the course catalog. Where can I find teaching units in the course catalog? Where can I find teaching units in the course catalog? Teaching units in the course catalog To view teaching units in campo , select “ Courses ” and then “ Show course catalog ”. The course catalog shows all degree programs at FAU listed by faculty. After selecting your degree program, you need to search for the correct degree program and examination regulations. Go to the “ Student service ” page and select the “ My degree programs ” tab where you will find the correct degree program and examination regulations listed by subject. After selecting the degree program and examination regulations, you can open the individual modules of the degree program under the levels with an orange tag icon (for example Bachelor’s examination/Master’s examination). Each module has a green puzzle icon. The teaching units are assigned to the relevant modules. Special cases Teaching Degree Although teaching degree programs (Lehramt) are based at the Faculty of Humanities, Social Sciences, and Theology, the science subjects such as biology, math or chemistry are listed in the course catalog for the Faculty of Sciences. The education science modules for teaching degrees in secondary education (Realschule and Gymnasium) are listed in the course catalog for the Faculty of Humanities, Social Sciences, and Theology under “Education Science”. Modules for teaching degrees in primary education (Grundschule) and secondary education (Mittelschule) are listed under the Faculty of Humanities, Social Sciences, and Theology in the area Primary Education (Grundschuldidaktik) and Secondary Education (Mittelschuldidaktik) respectively.

The FAU Press Office can help you will all aspects of science communication and engaging with the public. As there is increasing interest among the general population with regard to how public money is spent and what goes on at universities, researchers have a responsibility to explain their work and its benefits to the general public using appropriate methods and to enter into dialogue with them. This is often reflected in the funding agreements of third-party funding providers such as the DFG, which stipulate that research findings must be presented to the public effectively. Furthermore, public discussion always feeds back into research and makes it possible to view it from a different angle. The Press Office is happy to help you with the following topics: Press releases Press releases Have you just been awarded funding for a large research project or received a prize for your work? Are you about to publish an important paper or book or is something exciting happening at your institute (such as a teaching project or a unique partnership)? Or would you like to invite the general public to attend an event you are organising? Please contact the Press Office well in advance so that we can determine whether and how to present your news to a wide, non-specialist audience in an interesting way. It is generally not effective to issue press information after an event has already taken place or a paper has already been published. Please bear in mind that press releases should be aimed at a non-specialist audience – some facts and terminology that are self-evident to you as part of your everyday research will need to be explained, and complex concepts will need to be simplified for the general reader. The Press Office can help you do this. Please note: the aim of a press release is to make information available to the media should they wish to use it. There is no guarantee that it will be reproduced. Expert opinions Expert opinions Would you like to contribute to the debate on a current issue? Journalists often use background information that the Press Office presents in the ‘Nachgefragt’ series in which experts answer three questions. In many cases the Press Office will contact you directly because journalists are looking for an expert to answer a specific question. As the media is always under pressure to be up to date, it is important that you respond quickly – even if you decline because it is not your area of expertise or you are unavailable. If a media representative contacts you directly, the Press Office is happy to advise you on an questions you may have about their request, such as participating in a TV interview. Press conferences Press conferences Press conferences are only recommended for very important news or major conferences. The Press Office is happy to help you decide whether a press conference is appropriate for your topic. Please make sure you contact us in good time; the Press Office can then invite the media, can help you create information folders, and may be able to provide assistance in person at the event. Images, photos, illustrations Images, photos, illustrations An informative image increases the likelihood of your topic being picked up by the media. Please provide high quality images that are also suitable for printing (7cm at 300 dpi) and ensure you clarify beforehand whether the copyright holder agrees to the image being used free-of-charge for the intended purposes (e.g. online, FAU publications, social media) and that it does not infringe on the rights of any third parties.

Methods of science communication Methods of science communication Documentaries, discussions, science slams, pecha kucha, science blogs, social media, hands-on experiments, public dialogue, popular science texts, science cafés – there is a suitable method of science communication for everyone. Talking to the public about your research allows you to gain new perspectives and is a lot of fun – not just extra work.

This is something scientists have to consider on a daily basis: just because something is possible doesn’t mean that it is ethically acceptable. As one of the largest research universities in Germany, FAU carries considerable social responsibility. The University strives to uphold good scientific practice, ethical standards, transparency, open access and responsible care of laboratory animals. Research and responsibility are inseparable. People are born with a thirst for knowledge and understanding. We have to actively and consciously commit to acting responsibly, however. This sense of responsibly guides us in all we do at FAU. Prof. Dr. Georg Schett, FAU Vice President Research Prof. Dr. Georg Schett (Image: FAU/Erich Malter) Research involving animal experimentation and animal protection at FAU FAU is one of the first to commit to the Transparent Animal Testing Initiative . For us, this underlines our commitment to taking a transparent and open approach to this sensitive and often controversial topic. When using animals in research, we are always guided by the three ‘R’s’ – refine, reduce, replace. That means that we only use animal testing where there is currently no other alternative. We reduce the number of animals we use to the absolute minimum and use the latest technology to minimize the animals’ stress during experiments. We are aware of our responsibility, a 4th ‘R’ to add to the list. Guiding principles Animal protection committee Animal protection officer Animal care Committees and points of contact FAU has set up various committees focusing on responsible research which are aware of the specific aspects and challenges this entails and which are on hand to help researchers in general and with more specific research-related questions. Ethics Commission A commission for the assessment of ethic and legal aspects of medical research in humans belongs to the Faculty of Medicine at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg. Ethics Committee for Security-Relevant Research The Ethics Committee for Security-Relevant Research is responsible for making recommendations for how to deal with research in the area of potential conflict between freedom of research and scientific responsibility protected under the German constitution, and assesses the extent to which research findings may be used for dual purposes (dual use research). Commission for the Investigation of Scientific Misconduct Good scientific practice is of pivotal importance to FAU. Claims of scientific misconduct are taken very seriously indeed. Such issues are conscientiously and thoroughly investigated by the Commission for the Investigation of Scientific Misconduct . Working Group for Memory Culture The Working Group for Memory Culture was founded as a working group for all faculties. It advises the Executive Board on questions regarding the history of the University and its responsibility for its actions in research, teaching and administration.

Everything is new, and you are sure to have a lot of questions, for example, which classes do I have to attend? How do I create a schedule? And where is the university library? Don’t worry, there is an answer to all your questions. Here we have some valuable tips for starting out at university. Be sure to read your e-mails from the University! They give you details about examination dates or pass on important information from the Executive Board. It may make sense to redirect your e-mail to an account you check regularly. Your first steps as a new student at FAU The first thing you have to do as a new student at FAU is to create a schedule , register for classes and attend introductory events . We will guide you through the process step by step. One more important tip for starting out: The order of the individual steps at your faculty may be different from that outlined here. For example, students in their first semester at the Faculty of Engineering first attend introductory sessions and then draw up their schedule. Getting off to a flying start The following tiles take you directly to the tips for new students. Schedule (campo) Creating your schedule Classes (StudOn) Registering for classes Introductory events Overview of events. How to create your schedule Which classes do I have to choose? Which classes do I have to choose? Check your degree program and examination regulations Please refer to your degree program and examination regulations or the module handbook for your degree program to find out which seminars, courses, lectures etc. you have to attend. Select the version of the degree program and examination regulations applicable to you. When starting your first subject semester, this is normally the latest version, which is listed at the very top of the list under “consolidated versions”. If you are unsure: The correct version of the examination regulations is available under the relevant subject on campo by going to the “ Student service ” page and selecting “ My degree programs ”. Grundlagen- und Orientierungsprüfung (GOP) When selecting classes, please pay special attention to which modules you have to complete for the Grundlagen- und Orientierungsprüfung (GOP) . This is not an additional examination. It consists of individual examination achievements from several modules completed during the program. You are required to complete modules accounting for a certain number of ECTS credits by the end of the third semester at the latest. The number of ECTS credits varies according to faculty. The degree program and examination regulations stipulate which modules have to be completed for the GOP. Please note: In many cases it is only possible to repeat examinations relevant to or necessary for the GOP one time. Degree program structure The degree program structures are included as appendices to degree program and examination regulations and are extremely useful. You can use them to check the names of the teaching units included in a module how many and which teaching units belong to a module which semester they should be taken in. This helps you to select the correct teaching units from the course catalog. Where can I find teaching units in the course catalog? Where can I find teaching units in the course catalog? Teaching units in the course catalog To view teaching units in campo , select “ Courses ” and then “ Show course catalog ”. The course catalog shows all degree programs at FAU listed by faculty. After selecting your degree program, you need to search for the correct degree program and examination regulations. Go to the “ Student service ” page and select the “ My degree programs ” tab where you will find the correct degree program and examination regulations listed by subject. After selecting the degree program and examination regulations, you can open the individual modules of the degree program under the levels with an orange tag icon (for example Bachelor’s examination/Master’s examination). Each module has a green puzzle icon. The teaching units are assigned to the relevant modules. Special cases Teaching Degree Although teaching degree programs (Lehramt) are based at the Faculty of Humanities, Social Sciences, and Theology, the science subjects such as biology, math or chemistry are listed in the course catalog for the Faculty of Sciences. The education science modules for teaching degrees in secondary education (Realschule and Gymnasium) are listed in the course catalog for the Faculty of Humanities, Social Sciences, and Theology under “Education Science”. Modules for teaching degrees in primary education (Grundschule) and secondary education (Mittelschule) are listed under the Faculty of Humanities, Social Sciences, and Theology in the area Primary Education (Grundschuldidaktik) and Secondary Education (Mittelschuldidaktik) respectively.

We will also report back on ongoing results, savings and progress at FAU. Saving energy together during the dark winter months Energy consumption increases due to the weather during the dark winter months, particularly for heating and electricity. Join us again and help to save energy in your department – the following tips will help you. The Green Office has information about energy consumption on its website in the Energy management section. In addition, FAU members can download detailed information about buildings . #FAUsavesEnergy Our motto is #FAUsavesEnergy. Let’s all take this to heart and do everything we can to make it a reality. At the same time, this will help us reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and work towards reaching net zero quicker than originally planned ( see BayKlimaG ). Use the hashtag #FAUspartenergie to share the ways you are saving energy on social media with us and the world and generate more awareness of this important topic. What we can all do on a daily basis Heating/warmth Stromverbrauch in the office in research in der Lehre im Hochleistungsrechnen Heating/warmth Heating/warmth Turn the heating down (overnight) and switch it off when it is not needed (for example at the weekend) Reduce room temperature as far as possible; you can adjust to a lower room temperature by, for example, wearing warmer clothes Close doors, air rooms by opening windows wide for a short period of time instead of leaving the window tilted all the time Cut down on using warm water at the sink, if you have one Stromverbrauch Electricity consumption Stop using fan heaters, fans and other ineffective sources of heat/electricity Switch off or replace old appliances such as fridges Switch off PCs, monitors, printers and other devices instead of leaving them on standby Reduce screen brightness to between 50 and 75% (saves over 25% energy), switch off second monitors Avoid using lifts unless necessary for transporting items Check whether fax machines are still necessary (they use electricity when kept in standby mode) Use socket strips with toggle switches in the office in the office Evening checks (lights off? Windows shut? Appliances turned off?) Agree on fixed office hours for your team in consultation with your manager and adjust heating and lighting accordingly Communicate possibilities for action, mention and raise awareness for energy saving measures among colleagues, pass on your knowledge and establish energy teams Share electrical devices such as coffee machines and kettles in break rooms or kitchens and fill thermos flasks with coffee or hot water and have joint coffee breaks. Kettles should be descaled after a maximum of three months. in research in research Reduce the number of devices left on standby when not in use Switch off devices such as centrifuges, heating cabinets and water baths in the evening or directly after use (except for those marked otherwise) Use socket strips with toggle switches Share use of laboratories/devices Introduce a booking schedule Bundle production jobs (warm-up periods) Only switch on those lights in the laboratory that you really need Only open fridges/freezers/cooling chambers briefly and avoid keeping the door open for long Check the temperature of the cooling chamber Run freezers at -70°C rather than -80°C (28% saving), do not run them at their limit Replace old, inefficient appliances and devices including appliances such as fridges (funding available for replacing old appliances from municipal authorities) Ensure sufficient air can circulate around devices that emit a lot of waste heat, such as fridges or freezers. Remove servers from the broom cupboard. in der Lehre in teaching Switch everything off after a class or lecture (lights, projector, audio equipment etc.) Think about room bookings and keep the calendar updated: Does the size of the room match the number of students attending the lecture/taking the examination? The smaller the room, the less energy is consumed when it is in use. Is there another lecture after yours? – The fewer gaps there are between lectures, the less the air conditioning or heating is used in standby when the room is empty Have you entered any changes in Campo? – Lecture halls can only be managed effectively (heating, ventilation, lighting, caretaker, cleaning etc.) if you keep all details up to date. im Hochleistungsrechnen Energy efficiency in high performance computing Optimized programs use energy more efficiently and generate “more research per joule” If you have any questions, please use the services provided by our HPC experts: HPC Café Contact the FAU HPC Team Share your ideas with us!

When processing personal data required for the performance of a contract in which the contractual party is the data subject, Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR forms the legal basis. This also applies if data has to be processed in order to carry out pre-contractual activities. Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR forms the legal basis if personal data has to be processed in order to fulfil a legal obligation on the part of our organisation. Art. 6 (1) (d) GDPR forms the legal basis in the case that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person make the processing of personal data necessary. If data processing is necessary in order to protect the legitimate interests of our organisation or of a third party and if the interests, basic rights and fundamental freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh the interests mentioned above, Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR forms the legal basis for such data processing.

Research Associations are set up in response to contemporary affairs or as a direct investment in the future to secure Bavaria’s strength in research and industry. They also involve partners from industry who are actively involved in research in addition to providing funding. The private public partnership ensures that the results of the research are quickly put into practice. Public funding is provided by the Bavarian Research Foundation and the Bavarian Ministries, in particular the Bavarian State Ministry of Science and the Arts. BayKlimaFit 2 – Strong plants mitigating the impact of climate change BayKlimaFit 2 – Strong plants mitigating the impact of climate change Climate change is one of the most significant challenges faced by the human race – a global phenomenon with consequences on a regional level. Successful and sustainable climate policy is based on scientific findings and applied research relevant to issues currently facing our climate. The Department of Biology and the Chair of Biochemistry at FAU are contributing their own research in this area. From 2016 to 2019, the BayKlimaFit 1 project investigated how crop plants in Bavaria can adapt to climate change. The project focused on breeding plants that have improved tolerance against changing environmental conditions. The research is now being continued in the BayKlimaFit 2 project to develop solutions from the initial project. BayKlimaFit 2 – “Strong plants mitigating the impact of climate change” is conducting research in 10 projects on the following topics: High-quality and climate-resilient plants Healthy plants during climate change Efficient plant cultivation despite climate stress The Bavarian State Ministry of the Environment and Consumer Protection is funding the research project for a period of three years. To BayKlimaFit 2 website BayUFP – Measuring, characterizing and analyzing ultrafine particles BayUFP – Measuring, characterizing and analyzing ultrafine particles Particulate matter is a health hazard. Scientific proof that this is the case has been available since the mid 1990s. However, scientists have been unsure whether ultrafine particles, the smallest components of particulate matter, constitute an additional risk factor in their own right. This is the topic that the Bavarian project BayUFP – “Measuring, characterizing and analyzing ultrafine particles” is now researching, financed by the Bavarian State Ministry of the Environment and Consumer Protection. The network focuses on measuring techniques, chemical characterization, molecular mechanisms, toxicology and epidemiology. It is hoped that this joint, coordinated research will make a significant contribution to closing existing gaps in research and thereby to protecting and safeguarding the health of the Bavarian population, now and in the future. To BayUFP website SHIELD - Sichere heimische (Bio-) Lebensmittel durch sensorische Detektionsverfahren (safe regional organic and conventional foodstuffs using a sensor-based detection procedure) SHIELD - Sichere heimische (Bio-) Lebensmittel durch sensorische Detektionsverfahren (safe regional organic and conventional foodstuffs using a sensor-based detection procedure) Diagram: Research association SHIELD The research association aims to ensure food safety along the value chain using rapid and efficient detection methods which can accurately detect damaged or rotten products along the process chain. Automated data analysis will improve digital traceability along the value chain and improve the safety and quality of foodstuffs by optimizing logistics. At present, 53% of foodstuffs are lost along the entire value chain in the case of conventional agriculture and 56% in organic agriculture. Reducing food loss while maintaining food safety is therefore an important goal for society. Requirements for food quality and their definition are many-faceted and are not only dependent on consumers and their expectations, but also on plans and strategies for how the foodstuffs are to be used or processed further. The guiding idea behind this project is to analyze the quality and safety of raw materials at the point of acceptance, to establish methods to prove the authenticity of raw materials and the foodstuffs that are produced, to draw up quality prognoses, and to optimize logistics chains in order to address the actual requirements of the food industry and consumers. The project will take a holistic and interdisciplinary approach and focus on three areas: 1) Needs analysis 2) Quality assurance for foodstuffs 3) Storage and logistics The over-riding goal is to find an accurate method to determine the quality of organic and conventional raw materials along the food supply chain that will allow them to be made available for further processing or entered into the retail supply chain without incurring excessive food waste. The various methods to be considered include sensor technologies, optical methods and intelligent algorithms that can also be used in small businesses via handheld devices and smart software. These practical devices will be based on authentic samples from industrial partners, followed by the identification and definition of the relevant key performance indicators using high-performance analytics or using data to develop corresponding algorithms. In addition, the actual requirements for solutions for safe local organic food will be based on as representative a number as possible of the total of 4,500 organic companies in Bavaria. This is a crucial aspect in order to ensure that the knowledge gained during the project and its findings can be subsequently put to good use within these companies. Interest in becoming involved in the project run by the research association SHIELD is high throughout industry. The companies involved are either purely organic companies (such as Kartoffelkombinat, HiPP, Kloster Plankstetten), mixed operations that produce and sell both organic products and conventional products (e.g. Burgis, Franken-Gemüse, Lebkuchen Schmidt) or companies that are not able to operate organically due to the sector they are involved in (e.g. the company Singer und Sohn, mechanical engineering). The industrial partners take an active part in the project by providing their expertise and suitable problem datasets and validating the results generated by the scientific partners. To SHIELD website ForDaySec – Security in everyday digitalization ForDaySec – Security in everyday digitalization ForDaySec is an interdisciplinary research association aimed at improving IT security in everyday digital life. The focus is on the development of technologies and solutions suitable for everyday use that can be used to safely exploit the opportunities of digitization in various areas of life and work. To this end, researchers from computer science, sociology and law from five Bavarian universities are working closely together – with the common goal of providing orientation for people in today’s world. The research is guided by the living and working realities of people and companies. Technical, social and legal expertise is pooled in four network-wide topics, pursuing the aim of gaining a comprehensive understanding and developing feasible approaches for solutions for digital security. The specific research questions in the sub-projects include: Is data protection guaranteed in the case of app-controlled devices in the Internet of Things (IoT)? Who is liable for IT security loopholes in IoT devices? The purchaser or the manufacturer? How are IoT devices used in daily life and how competent are users? How are users integrated into their organizations and institutions when using these devices? How can IoT devices be safely integrated into existing systems and secure company networks (e.g. by using encryption)? How can insecure devices be encapsulated into these systems and monitored? How can software developers use software components and training environments to establish data protection skills with a focus on usability and explainability? To ForDaySec website ForNeRo - Seamless and Ergonomic Integration of Robotics into the Clinical Workflow ForNeRo - Seamless and Ergonomic Integration of Robotics into the Clinical Workflow The introduction of assistive robot systems into clinical workflows leads to a considerable increase in the technical, social and organizational complexity in the operating room. Providing and installing the systems leads to significant delays, even when using the latest models, which limits the extent to which surgical robots are used, especially for short procedures. Placing the robotic system or its individual modules on the human body has a significant influence on its subsequent performance and must be undertaken in consideration of the patient’s anatomy and the available working space. In order to be able to use the robot’s advantages effectively, it is crucial that humans and technology work together hand in hand and carefully attuned with each other. This can only be achieved by interlinking the various processes of individual operation planning as closely as possible, taking into account the parameters of the individual patients, imaging, documentation and integration into the surgery surroundings. The ForNeRo research association therefore aims to facilitate considerable improvements in the efficiency, usability and ergonomics of surgical robots thanks to the outstanding expertise available in the association concerning the implementation of ergonomic principles and clinically-centered implementation of user-centered simulations, AR applications and UI technology. These approaches will be key technologies for the future of robotic surgery and digital medicine. Achieving this objective hinges on nurturing close links between this expertise and users at the clinic and involving competent industrial partners from Bavaria. To ForNeRo website Other research projects “Made in Bavaria” The Bavarian government provides support to the State of Bavaria as a key location for research in several specific fields. On the one hand, project applications are selected and approved in multi-stage procedures on the basis of specific calls for applications (for example in the Bavarian Collaborative Research Program) and ideas for projects on current issues are proactively supported by Bavarian ministries on the other. Some of the most significant projects are listed and described briefly below: GAB 2.0 - Geothermal Alliance Bavaria GAB 2.0 - Geothermal Alliance Bavaria Geothermal energy is an important domestic source of energy suitable for covering base load demand. However, its potential has been largely overlooked until now. If we are to continue increasing the acceptance, economic viability and safety of this technology, an interdisciplinary approach to research is required with which the potential of geothermal energy can be exploited as efficiently and intelligently as possible, across all regions and throughout the seasons. Secure long-term funding is also required if we are to continue benefiting from these resources in the future. Bavaria is a pioneer within Germany when it comes to using deep geothermal energy. However, until now its application has been restricted to the Munich area and parts of Upper and Lower Bavaria, where information was already available on the properties of the deep geological substratum after seismic and drilling data were collected for the purpose of exploring hydrocarbon deposits. The potential of the crystalline areas of Northern Bavaria as a source of deep geothermal energy has not yet been exploited at all. Little has been done to investigate the substratum and its properties in Northern Bavaria, and no deep exploratory drilling has been conducted for geothermal pilot projects. The situation is compounded by the fact that different methods are required to use deep geothermal energy from crystalline layers, and this technology is still at the early stages of development. The metropolitan area of Munich clearly demonstrates the benefits of deep geothermal energy sources, especially when it comes to providing heating to large urban areas. One way of making a greater contribution to reducing the dependence of district heating on fossil fuels at the same time as increasing the utilization of existing geothermal plants would be to coordinate heat sources and heat sinks better and connect them over larger distances. To date, it has not always been possible to make accurate predictions about the chances of finding heat sources and their potential productivity in certain areas of Bavaria. We must continue to find and raise awareness of feasible ways for incorporating this new technology into the existing energy system. Geothermal Alliance Bavaria (Geothermie-Allianz Bayern – GAB) is a collaborative research project between Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), Technische Universität München (TUM) and Universität Bayreuth (UBT) which was formed in 2016, and which welcomed two new members Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU) and Hochschule München (HSM) when the second phase of funding was launched in 2020. The Munich School of Engineering (MSE) at TUM coordinates the project. It is responsible for centralized administrative tasks, as well as liaising between the various partner universities and operators of geothermal power plants and the general public. The overriding goal of the Geothermal Alliance Bavaria is to bolster deep geothermal energy as a domestic source of energy and to significantly improve the climate footprint of the heating and electricity sectors. With its interdisciplinary research focus, GAB hopes to spotlight the opportunities and risks of the technology, as well as to find solutions to obstacles hindering the expansion of deep geothermal energy as a renewable energy source. At the same time, it hopes to expand the extent to which deep geothermal energy is used, make it more cost-effective, manage the reservoir sustainably and ensure that operations are safe. Geothermal resources ought to be explored and used as far as possible in all areas and tailored to meet the needs in each specific instance, taking the potential above and below ground into account. For this purpose, the deeper substratum and the geothermal resources of Northern Bavaria which have until now only been investigated sporadically will be analyzed systematically. The Geothermal Alliance Bavaria is pursuing its aims in the following sub-projects: Sub-project: “efficient. Heat transition through the intelligent use of deep geothermal energy” (TUM, UBT, HSM) Sub-project: “regional. Systematic exploration of new potentials” (FAU, UBT, TUM) Sub-project: “social. Climate protection through a safe technology” (TUM, LMU, UBT) Sub-project: “long-term. Sustainable thermal water production” (TUM, FAU) Sub-project: Joint Master’s degree program in GeoThermics/GeoEnergy (FAU, TUM, LMU) To GAB 2.0 website To the website of the Chair of Geology DigiOnko DigiOnko In all areas of breast cancer care, it makes sense to combine digital and real-world care structures that cover prevention, screening, therapy, and follow-up. In the process, we need to protect digital sovereignty and focus on benefits to the individual. The aim of the digiOnko project, which is funded by the Bavarian State Ministry of Health and Care, is to optimize all areas of breast cancer care through new, digital concepts. The project will establish inpatient and outpatient early detection programs that support individualized information and access to innovative screening measures and biomarker examinations. Patients undergoing breast cancer therapy have the opportunity to use a digital home healthcare center (an app developed as part of the project) and can independently record ECG, blood counts or blood glucose measurements from the comfort of their home, as well as independently documenting any side effects and impact of therapy on their quality of life. Using the app, patients can access 24-hour monitoring and communication in a private and secure environment. Large clinical data sets based on image data, histological or even genetic data are also used to establish new personalized risk assessments and therapy decisions by means of artificial intelligence (AI) improving individualized prevention, therapy and relapse prevention in the long term. To DigiOnko website Munich Quantum Valley Munich Quantum Valley Quantum computers open up a whole range of completely new opportunities in data and information processing, since their computing power significantly exceeds conventional computer architectures. The Munich Quantum Valley Project develops quantum computers using two complimentary technologies: superconducting quantum circuits and trapped-ion systems with the aim of making these quantum computers accessible to users via a shared cloud environment. The Department of Physics and the Department of Electrical Engineering at FAU are contributing to the project in the areas of algorithm development, processor design, control strategies and control electronics for quantum computers. The Munich Quantum Valley Project is being funded by the Bavarian State Ministry of Science and the Arts from October 1, 2021 to December 31, 2024.

Research funding provided by the German government seeks to find solutions to global challenges, increase Germany’s competitiveness and secure sustainable jobs. Project applications are selected and approved in a competitive procedure on the basis of specific calls for applications from various Federal Ministries. FAU receives the most funding from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) as well as from the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK). Some of the most significant projects are listed and described briefly below: MIRACUM MIRACUM MIRACUM – Medical Informatics in Research and Care in University Medicine is one of four consortia that receives funding from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research as part of the Medical Informatics Initiative (MII). From 2018 to 2022, the focus was on establishing data integration centers at university hospitals in Germany. From 2023 onwards, these data integration centers will be connected to regional hospitals and further medical care centers beyond the university hospitals. The consortia will also consolidate during this expansion phase of the MII. Six junior research groups have been established from MIRACUM. Furthermore, funding is also being provided for “Digitale FortschrittsHubs Gesundheit” (Digital progress hubs for health) via the MII, of which four of the six hubs have been formed from the MIRACUM consortium. During the new funding phase, researchers will collaborate across sector boundaries in eight clinical and three methodological use cases. MIRACUM is participating in all of these use cases. FAU and Universitätsklinikum Erlangen will receive almost 8.2 million euros of funding from 2023 to 2026. Further funds of around 4.5 million euros are expected to be granted for clinical and methodological application projects in the MII. The consortium is led by Prof. Dr. Hans-Ulrich Prokosch, Chair of Medical Informatics, FAU. The project is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, funding references 01ZZ1606H , 01ZZ1801A and 01ZZ2301A from August 1, 2016 to December 31, 2026. Link to MIRACUM website Milk-TV Milk-TV The World Health Organization recommends that mothers breastfeed their babies for at least 6 months and for up to 2 years after introducing solids. Even though breast milk offers protection against serious illnesses and infections, there are some viruses that are transmitted via breast milk. This includes the human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1), a neglected retro and tumor virus that predominantly infects white blood cells (CD4+ T cells) and can lead to incurable illnesses after lifelong persistence. At least 5 to 10 million people worldwide are infected with HTLV-1, however many of them do not know they have the virus. The virus is transmitted via bodily fluids containing cells, including blood products, seminal fluid and breast milk, which is mainly responsible for the transmission of HTLV-1 from mother to child. The risk of transmitting the virus increases with the duration of breastfeeding, but refraining from breastfeeding is not an option in countries where resources are limited or within under-represented ethnic groups such as ethnic minorities. Although our understanding of how the virus is transmitted from cell to cell on a molecular level continues to improve, it remains unclear which cells in which organs are infected first via breast milk, how these cells are infected and how breast milk influences the infection of these cells. Furthermore, the development of prevention strategies that still allow breastfeeding, above all in economically underdeveloped regions, is urgently required. We intend to take an experiment-based approach to tackling these questions. For this purpose, we will use various tissue culture models and develop HTLV-1 specific single-domain antibodies that can be used in therapy. Our central aim is to develop prevention strategies that ultimately allow infants to gain from the benefits of breastfeeding without being exposed to an increased risk of HTLV-1 transmission. The project is being funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, reference number 01KI2023 , from November 1, 2020 to October 31, 2025. Software Campus Software Campus The aim of Software Campus is to provide training for doctoral candidates who work on a research project funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (microproject) at a participating R&D institution in cooperation with a partner in industry. Software Campus is geared towards doctoral candidates with excellent grades and references and a creative entrepreneurial spirit, who are ideally at the beginning of their doctoral degree in computer science. Doctoral candidates from other subjects relevant to computer science can also be considered if they have a strong interest in IT and possess the relevant fundamental skills. Building on participants’ subject knowledge, this program teaches the most important core skills for managers in corporate and innovation processes, including market interrelationships, corporate functions and strategies, planning and innovation processes in technology, project management and the fundamentals of HR. The project is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, funding references 01IS17045 and 01IS23071, from November 1, 2017 to December 31, 2027. Link to Software Campus website AGEnTs AGEnTs Antimicrobial resistance has become one of the world’s most serious health problems. Attempts to develop new or improved antimicrobial chemotherapy drugs have had only limited success up to now. The problem requires innovative approaches during the development of new therapies. The naturally acquired immunity of humans has evolved during the course of millions of years and transferring natural immune cells (known as T cells) to treat infectious diseases has been proven to be safe and effective in clinical trials, even in cases where conventional drugs were no longer effective. This applies in particular to infections with the herpesviridae family of viruses, which can be fatal for patients with a suppressed immune system. However, the fact that these cell therapies have to be tailored to each patient prevents their widespread use. Even though genetic engineering can be used to increase the variability of T cell therapies, modifying the cells in this way also causes profound changes to their physiology. New “genetic scissors” such as CRISPR/Cas9 mean that it is now possible to produce genetically modified T cells that are very similar to physiological T cells for the first time. The aim of the project is to improve natural immunity to herpesviridae that are resistant to chemotherapy by using physiologically modified T cells (Physiological Advanced Genetically Engineered T cells – AGEnTs). The goal is to develop safe, functional therapeutic T cell products for widespread use using pioneering genetic engineering techniques. The long-term objectives of the research project are to combine the advantages of physiological immunity and cell engineering in order to develop therapies for patients suffering from other infectious diseases that are resistant to conventional drugs. The project is being funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, reference number 01KI2013 , from March 1, 2021 to February 28, 2026. Link to AGEnTs website (press release) MIRACUM DIFUTURE Alignment Hub (MIDIA-Hub) MIRACUM DIFUTURE Alignment Hub (MIDIA-Hub) The digital progress hub MIDIA-Hub is aimed at providing a new patient portal to exploit the potential of patient engagement in research and patient-generated data. A portal for physicians will improve communication between physicians based in hospitals and those with their own practices. These portals are linked to the hospitals’ clinical work station systems and will support integrated patient care processes across the various German health sectors. The university hospitals of the speakers of the MII consortia MIRACUM and DIFUTURE (Erlangen and Munich) have therefore decided to come together and coordinate their DIC concepts and their technological approaches in order to establish an innovative platform for exchanging health information. Siemens Healthineers is also included in the consortium as a technological partner with its teamplay Digital Health Platform (tDHP) forming the technological basis. We will design, develop, provide and evaluate functions for exchanging patient data for three MIDIA-Hub applications that allow healthcare professionals and patients appropriate access to a patient’s longitudinal health file and guarantee a secure electronic transfer of information. These applications are 1. digital support for oncological follow-up care provided by physicians with their own practices in order to gain a better insight into the results of oncological treatment, 2. digital support for long-term care for multiple sclerosis patients by exchanging patient data across various sectors and 3. the dynamic digital management of patient consent, using the modular MII declaration of consent, and providing personalized digital information for patients concerning the use of their data in research projects. The project is being funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, reference number 01ZZ2102A , from July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2025. MIDIA-Hub website SiC Quantum Memory Nodes for a Distributed Quantum Computing Network (QMNDQCNet) SiC Quantum Memory Nodes for a Distributed Quantum Computing Network (QMNDQCNet) This project focuses on implementing scalable quantum memory nodes for creating a “distributed quantum computing network”. Quantum memory nodes such as these can be created in a solid state body via an optically active quantum system and controllable nuclear spins. Silicon vacancy centers (color centers) in 4H-SiC are being used as a quantum system for implementing the research project. Silicon vacancy centers in 4H-SiC are optically active quantum systems that are suitable for such applications due to their spectral stability and a coherent controllable electron spin. The aim is to implement addressable, scalable and robust quantum memories using 13C and 29Si nuclear spins. The aim of this research project is to demonstrate a distributed quantum computer network comprising two quantum memory nodes and six nuclear spin qubits (three per node). The project is being funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, reference number 13N16264 , from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2026. Automated manufacturing processes for electric road systems for the electrification of heavy goods vehicle traffic (E|MPower) Automated manufacturing processes for electric road systems for the electrification of heavy goods vehicle traffic (E|MPower) The Institute for Factory Automation and Production Systems (FAPS) is consortium leader of the new E|MPOWER collaborative project with partners VIA IMC, Autobahn GmbH, Electreon, Risomat and TH Nürnberg. The project is being funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, reference number 01MV22020A, as part of the “Elektro-Mobil” program, and also has the backing of Deutsche Autobahn GmbH. One key aim of the project is the integration of the wireless electric road system (ERS) technology from Electreon on a one kilometer long section of the highway in Northern Bavaria. This ERS uses inductive charging technology that is directly integrated into the road surface and facilitates contactless energy transfer to stationary and moving vehicles. The project is being funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, reference number 01MV22020A from July 1, 2022 until June 30, 2025. Link to E|MPower website Open6GHub Open6GHub Logo Open6GHub Reliable and high-performance communication networks are an important driver of innovation in our digital society. To shape our digital future effectively and in line with our requirements, it is vital that Germany and Europe have technological superiority. To ensure that Germany plays a leading role in designing 6G, the next generation of mobile communication technology, and to ensure the technology is firmly established in Europe, the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) is providing funding of around 68 million euros for the Open6GHub project during the next four years (2022–2025). The Open6GHub is developing a 6G vision for digital sovereignty in a hyperconnected world from 2030 and is designing a 6G system that will save resources and be energy efficient, protect personal information and ensure high network availability. The design criteria for collaboration in the Open6GHub will focus on the needs of society (sustainability, climate protection, data protection, resilience, participation) as well as the competitiveness of our companies and our technological superiority. The consortium, comprising 47 research groups from 11 universities and six extramural research institutions, is focusing on application fields requiring very high standards of quality and security in communication technology: smart cities, highly connected production, future mobility scenarios, new worlds of learning, personalized medicine and, above all, human interaction with a large number of autonomous vehicles and devices, which are examples of a world that will be characterized by 6G from 2030 onwards. In addition, 6G is also likely to play a key role in accelerated digitalization for the purposes of sustainability and the implementation of climate policy targets. Providing equal coverage to rural areas is another aim of the Open6GHub, for which 6G research is being carried out into satellite connections, for example. Within the context of these focal areas, the project will contribute to a global 6G harmonization process and standard in Europe in order to strengthen Germany and Europe’s position in international competition for 6G. The project is being funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, reference number 16KISK005 from August 1, 2022 until July 31, 2025. Link to Open6GHub website Interfaces in Immunomedicine (iIMMUNE_ACS) Interfaces in Immunomedicine (iIMMUNE_ACS) The Advanced Clinician Scientist (ACS) Program i IMMUNE_ACS supports outstanding clinicians who carry out research after they have completed their specialist medical training. It is an extension of the Clinician Scientist program at the Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research (IKZF) for physicians who are completing specialist training. The ACS Fellows who receive funding have the opportunity to carry out a research project in the field of immunomedicine during the course of 6 years and to prepare for a clinical and scientific management position in an in-depth interdisciplinary training program. i IMMUNE_ACS ensures that the specialists who receive funding are guaranteed that 50% of their time is set aside for research and receive additional funding for research. An individually appointed team of mentors provides support to the ACS fellows in achieving their defined goals. i IMMUNE_ACS is part of a nationwide ACS program that the Federal Ministry of Education and Research is funding at a total of 8 locations in Germany. The collaboration of these ACS programs across locations and joint events offer all ACS fellows a wide variety of opportunities to exchange information and network with others and participate in the training provided at other locations. i IMMUNE_ACS is based at Deutsches Zentrum Immuntherapie (DZI). The project is being funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, reference number 01EO2105 from May 1, 2022 to April 30, 2024 (long-term planning until 2032) . Link to the website of i IMMUNE_ACS Development of a digitalized and automated value chain for Next-to-OEM wiring harness manufacturing (Next2OEM) Development of a digitalized and automated value chain for Next-to-OEM wiring harness manufacturing (Next2OEM) The Next2OEM research project addresses the entire value chain of wiring harness systems for automotive applications. The aim of the project is to digitalize and automate the value chain to facilitate the reshoring of wiring harness manufacturing to Germany. Next-to-OEM wiring harness manufacturing involves developing highly automated solutions for wiring harness manufacturing and assembly in the vehicle at OEM that are set up in a demonstrator and linked together. Digital consistency is ensured for orchestrating automated manufacturing and traceability to the component and process level using an innovative information model that provides a semantic description of the product and the newly developed manufacturing processes. The project consortium includes partners from the entire value chain. This ensures holistic automation solutions for all steps of the process including everything from plug-in connector manufacturing and cable assembly, shaping, cable protection, testing and logistics to the assembly of the wiring harness into the car body using a self-sufficient central console wiring harness. A prototype of the linked assembly line at consortium leader AUDI AG validates the practicability and forms the basis for potential further development to volume production. The Next2OEM project, with a total funding amount of over 24 million euros, will run from February 2023 until January 2026. The project partners are TE Connectivity and KOSTAL Kontakt Systeme as connector manufacturers, semantic PDM for the development of the graph-based information model, and Kromberg and Schubert as wiring harness manufacturers. Other important partners in automation include Komax Taping, Komax Testing, Stefani Maschinenbau, BÄR Automation and ArtiMinds Robotics. As consortium leader, AUDI AG is responsible for designing on-board network architectures and the assembly process into the car body. As part of a research network and with a project budget of almost 2.3 million euros, the Institute for Factory Automation and Production Systems carries out research on topics related to the digital factory and the traceability of products and processes and the automation of cable sheathing and assembly of the wiring harness into the car body. The project is being funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, reference number 13IK026D from February 1, 2023 until January 31, 2026 . Link to Next2OEM website Diagnostics with biomarker patterns from extracellular vesicles in plasma using artificial intelligence methods (KI-VesD-2) Diagnostics with biomarker patterns from extracellular vesicles in plasma using artificial intelligence methods (KI-VesD-2) Liquid biopsy test systems would be an ideal tool for early tumor detection and follow-up checks. The new approach being used in KI-VesD (“Künstliche Intelligenz-unterstützte Vesikel Diagnostik” – Artificial intelligence-based vesicle diagnostics) records the innate immune reaction to the development of tumors. This is carried out by quantifying enzymatic and non-enzymatic factors in plasma extracellular vesicles (pEV) and evaluating them using artificial intelligence (AI), thus achieving high sensitivity and specificity and enabling treatment to be monitored. We developed two test systems to do so: A Point-of-Care (PoC) screening test and a confirmation test for use in a central laboratory. The special feature of this collaborative project is the involvement of several clinical departments for clinical studies in Erlangen (Dermatology, Urology, Hemato-Oncology, Transfusion Medicine) as well as an institute for microfluidics (Hahn-Schickard, Freiburg) for manufacturing test hardware, for example a PoC device. In the first project phase (2 years, beginning in 2020), excellent results were achieved for the test validation milestones. These involved test robustness and reproducibility, equipment-based purification of pEV as well as the first AI-based analyses for tumor follow-up checks and early detection. The latter achieved an AU-ROC of 0.92-1.0 in the test samples (prostate cancer, melanoma and lymphoma). Important new features were incorporated such as pEV purification using SEC (DMC), for which a semi-automated device is being developed as well as reliable quantification of non-enzymatic factors using Olink® technology. Using AI enabled undesired influencing factors to be eliminated, considerably improving the evaluation. A combination of techniques and materials was found that enabled the tests to be automated. In addition to basic research, during the upcoming funding period until 2026, the scientists will conduct clinical studies, for example a planned multi-center study for the early detection and treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (in conjunction with the Department of Hemato-Oncology in Erlangen), a study for the early detection of prostate cancer (in conjunction with the Department of Urology in Erlangen), a study for treatment monitoring of metastasized prostate cancer (in conjunction with the Department of Nuclear Medicine and the Department of Urology in Erlangen) as well as studies for treatment monitoring of uveal melanoma with Tebentafusp and monitoring of the supporting treatment of melanoma patients in stage II and III (in conjunction with the Department of Dermatology in Erlangen). The project is being funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, reference number 16LW0338K , from April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2026. Link to KI-VesD-2 website Digital Leadership & Communication and Cooperation Development (LeadCom) Digital Leadership & Communication and Cooperation Development (LeadCom) LeadCom offers head teachers and teachers who deal with digital school development at non-specialist and vocational schools a system of training and support with a focus on developing digital communication and cooperation and the change in digital leadership associated with it. The project partners from Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Hesse, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate will implement the following work packages: (1) Shaping a culture of digital communication and collaboration in schools and among the partners involved in the competence center, (2) developing and testing concepts to strengthen digital leadership among school administrators and leaders and multipliers in this area, (3) designing and implementing training and advice programs on digital leadership and digital communication and collaboration, and (4) ensuring transfer to practical application in schools. The center brings together previously used strategies, processes, models and measures and pursues a process of development using design-based research where schools, project and transfer partners actively collaborate. Training and advice programs and concepts for digital leadership as well as for a culture of digital communication and collaboration are designed and developed further on an ongoing basis. Research is also being carried out into the implementation of the programs and concepts. This involves a longitudinal evaluation of training available on the topic of digital leadership as well as on communication and collaboration taught online in the context of schools in order to implement an evidence-based approach to developing programs and concepts while taking the framework conditions of the German federal states into consideration. Another focus lies on the collaborative development of design concepts, the development of a culture of communication and cooperation and of the leadership skills profile.

Social duty With its strength in both fundamental research and application-oriented research, FAU has a significant contribution to make towards driving scientific and academic progress in key areas of society. FAU sees it as its duty to make this contribution, based on the principle of the freedom of teaching and research. Image: AMJ Gremsdorf As a university which offers the entire spectrum of academic disciplines, FAU generates knowledge in a wide range of disciplines covering the humanities, social sciences, economics, law, medicine, natural sciences and engineering. FAU strives to promote the dissemination of findings, ideas, developments and technology from all research areas, thereby contributing to scientific and academic progress. Publishing results in scientific and academic publications takes precedence over all other transfer activities. FAU also contributes to the common good of society by constantly delivering knowledge and technology which can be used as the basis for designing specific innovations. Technology transfer in this context does not only refer to invention and patent management but also to ongoing scientific training and advice on spin-offs or other such activities. Claim to exploitation Claim to exploitation Research findings generated at FAU can serve as the basis for developing innovative products, technologies and services. This means that the research findings have an inherent economic value going beyond the relevant findings themselves. This value can only be generated, however, by developing a product on the basis of the research. FAU conducts active invention and patent management in order to ensure that this value can be used for the benefit the University. FAU is aware that the process of developing a product fit for the market can only succeed in collaboration with extramural partners and that these partners will have to make further investments along the way. In order to ensure the economic viability of such investments, mechanisms for the protection of intellectual property have to be triggered in good time. The active IP policy followed by FAU therefore helps to translate the inherent value of the IP into a financial return at the same time as creating the basis for the University to share in these financial benefits whilst representing the interests of its inventors as well as possible. FAU is also keen to involve independent inventors such as students or scholarship holders, and gives them an equal standing to inventors employed by the University when sharing out proceeds generated by the commercial exploitation of IP. In the long term, FAU aims to generate proceeds for the University within the framework of university autonomy. In addition to the legally stipulated remuneration for the inventor (30 percent of generated income), the Chair behind a successful invention will receive a separate share of the proceeds which it can use as it wishes for research and teaching purposes. Criteria for registering IP rights for exploitation Criteria for registering IP rights for exploitation When safeguarding research findings and their exploitation, FAU pays particular attention to the interests of the inventors and the University, whilst bearing legal requirements (ArbnErfG, UrhG, BayHSchG) in mind at all times. FAU recognises that it is bound by generally accepted ethical and moral constraints of science, both with regard to the implementation of research projects and to the exploitation of findings generated as a result of this research. In particular, FAU takes care to ensure that safeguarding suitable research findings and exploiting them in their capacity as IP does not interfere with the researchers’ freedom to publish. The University draws on the expertise of law firms specialising in patents for safeguarding potentially patentable research findings in order to ensure that the requirements of the various disciplines are met. Inventions created at FAU are classed as either inventions covered by contracts which are transferred to industrial partners under the terms of individual or framework contracts or free inventions not bound to any contract in which case FAU is free to decide on their commercial exploitation. Joint inventions developed in collaboration with other research institutions are also classed as independent inventions. In all instances, the patent management team at FAU is the internal service provider and initial point of contact if you are an inventor seeking advice or would like to discuss a possible patent application strategy. They should also be consulted when selecting and commissioning external patent lawyers and can provide advice on the contents, administration and performance of contractual obligations When deciding on whether to apply for intellectual property rights to an independent invention, FAU focuses not only on criteria set out in patent law but first and foremost on the economic criteria of market relevance, options for commercial exploitation and economic potential. With regard to options for exploitation, the decision to protect the IP generated by a research project is taken after considering the extent to which value has been created or is expected to be created within the academic sphere in question. Projects which have either already reached a stage in their development or which are forecast to reach a stage at which they have the potential to significantly improve the options for exploitation ought to be protected by a suitable IP strategy, even if this means FAU has to make a long-term commitment. Another point which is taken into consideration when coming to a decision is whether the invention is potentially of interest to FAU’s industrial contacts and the Network of the Bavarian Patent Alliance (as the central patent exploitation agency for Bavarian institutions of higher education). Ideally, a successful transfer into the industrial sector should take place via existing networks of inventors or via FAU’s own networks. If there are no specific contacts available for any individual project, then the very least that is expected is that possible contacts in industry are identified beforehand. Close collaboration between inventors, Chairs and the project management team or BayPAT significantly improve a project’s chances of exploitation. Know-how and copyright Know-how and copyright In addition to exploiting IP by applying for a patent or other protection rights, results available in the form of know-how or material can be exploited directly by being licensed or sold. The term ‘know-how’ can refer to items such as valuable biological material, for example hybridoma cell lines used to produce monoclonal antibodies for scientific purposes, transgenic cell lines or organisms. The results protected by copyright can be rights to texts or images, or computer software. Along the lines of the remuneration paid to inventors, FAU also provides remuneration to scientists involved in generating results protected by copyright amounting to 30 percent of net proceeds. FAU makes all research results available to society in detail and without delay in the form of academic publications, irrespective of their potential for commercial exploitation as intellectual property. Principles of exploitation Principles of exploitation When making arrangements for commercial exploitation, FAU will pay particular consideration to the benefit to society as a whole and will prioritise this over short-term financial gain. If it becomes apparent that an invention is likely to be of particular significance, the University will choose non-exclusive arrangements over an exclusive contract in order to meet its obligations to serve the common good. In cases in which it is apparent that a prospective interested party does not have any genuine intention to develop the invention further and merely intends to restrict free competition (blocking patent), FAU will choose not to conclude a contract with this interested party. Inventions in the area of military and arms technology, nuclear technology and secret communications engineering are a special case. In these instances, FAU will take a stance in each individual case after internal consultations. A statement is drawn up by the patent management team and submitted to the Executive Board which takes the decision. The inventor must refrain from publishing until a decision has been taken. Exploitation routes Exploitation routes There are various routes which can be taken to make IP available for commercial exploitation, each of which entail particular opportunities and risks. Contractual obligations vis-à-vis third parties, third-party rights and other factors relevant to the the inventions are taken into consideration accordingly. IP is transferred from FAU to the respective partners at normal market conditions applicable to the specific product environment. FAU retains in all instances a simple, indefinite right of use for research and teaching purposes. The freedom to publish remains unaffected, and legitimate interests of third parties shall be taken into consideration accordingly. IP rights belonging to FAU can be exploited via a licence or purchase contract. When arranging exploitation, the fair market value of the IP rights is taken as the basis for agreeing conditions, whereby FAU will strive to obtain a long-term participation in the invention’s commercial success, which is also in the interests of its inventors. In addition, the financial expenditure for the patent application procedure should be re-financed with the proceedings from a patent sale or licence agreement. Spin-off based on the invention Spin-off based on the invention FAU explicitly encourages the establishment of companies (spin-offs or start-ups) based on the research results in order to drive their implementation into products ready for the market and thereby create jobs. Future-oriented, technology-based spin-offs and their financing by investors are based mainly on inventions and property rights. In particular, FAU will choose the route of transferring IPR in return for participation as a minority shareholder in order to get the best possible return from the IPR assets. Alternatively, the University will grant the right to use the IP by issuing a licence to the founding company. Within the framework of its legal possibilities, FAU will take the limited financial resources of university-based spin-offs which are just starting out into account in favour of a later participation in their success. FAU shall also stand by this principle if it becomes necessary to sell IP, for example within the context of financing rounds. Summary The autonomy of the University means that it has both the opportunity and the obligation to exploit all potential of research results in a sustainable and targeted way.

All aspects of the researchers’ work is centred around controlling light in every way; in space and time, in polarisation and in its quantum properties. The Institute was founded in 2009, making it the newest of around 80 Max Planck Institutes in Germany. It originated from the Max Planck research group ‘Optics, Information and Photonics’ at FAU which strengthened FAU’s long-standing reputation in the field of optics and provided new insights across multiple disciplines between 2004 and 2008. MPL has three departments, several independent research groups, and three technical service and development groups. Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light (MPL) International Max Planck Research School Physics of Light (IMPRS-PL) In collaboration with the FAU, the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light (MPL) runs an international Master and doctorate program that offers MSc stipends and PhD positions. Key features of IMPRS-PL are: structured graduate program English as language of instruction and interaction international and interdisciplinary environment MSc stipends and funded PhD positions excellent research conditions additional networking and career development opportunities International Max Planck Research School Physics of Light (IMPRS-PL) Max Planck Centre for Physics and Medicine Interdisciplinarity is the keyword for research at the Max Planck Centre for Physics and Medicine (ZMP) in Erlangen. Researchers from FAU, Universitätsklinikum Erlangen and the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Light will collaborate here at the interface between physics and medicine. For example, this will involve taking a closer look at the mechanical, electrical or chemical processes that occur in inflammation or in tumours. The findings will be applied directly in diagnosis and therapies thus benefiting patients. The cooperation agreement for establishing the centre was signed in July 2017. The centre will be set up on the site of Universitätsklinikum and is to include several new Chairs and interdisciplinary research groups as well as a new department for the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Light. Max Planck Centre for Physics and Medicine (ZMP) International Max Planck Research School Physics and Medicine (IMPRS-PM) IMPRS-PM is located at the Max-Planck-Zentrum für Physik und Medizin. The international Master and doctorate program that offers MSc stipends and PhD positions is therefore jointly run by the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), the University Hospital Erlangen (UKER) and the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light (MPL).

Often disciplines and institutions need to work together to find answers. Collaboration means that topics can be dealt with at scale beyond the capability of a single institute. The demand for research networks is higher than ever before. FAU has an international perspective and is open to sharing knowledge in collaborative projects. Exchanging information and knowledge within the University is equally as important as collaborating with researchers at other national or international institutions. Collaborative research is a mutual process that benefits everyone involved. At FAU, the impetus for collaborative research is established at the research level in a bottom-up approach supported centrally by the University. The University supports this approach in many different ways including retreats for identifying joint research topics, start-up funding and advice for preparing joint research initiatives, providing support for innovative research ideas and access to central institutes and strategic partnerships. In the international U-Multirank university ranking, FAU has received an excellent rating in research, knowledge transfer and international focus.

Established on 4 November 1743 by Margrave Friedrich von Brandenburg-Bayreuth and expanded from 1769 by Margrave Alexander von Brandenburg-Ansbach and Brandenburg-Bayreuth, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität was transferred to the state of Bavaria in 1810. It has been housed in the former margraviate residence in Erlangen since 1818. The Nürnberger Hochschule für Wirtschafts- und Sozialwissenschaften, a college of business, economics and social sciences, was integrated into FAU in 1961, as was the Pädagogische Hochschule Nürnberg, a teacher training college, in 1972. Today, approximately 38,000 students are enrolled at our FAU campuses in Erlangen, Nuremberg and Fürth. We promote an academic culture of remembrance reflecting the university’s responsibility for its actions in research, teaching and administration. When considering the history of our University, we take a self-critical stance towards our institutionalized academic culture and live up to society’s requirements for transparency.

Our FAU invention highlights gives an eye-opening list of ideas which were born at FAU and led to exciting discoveries, inventions and innovations. The history of innovation at FAU at a glance Mp3 format Image: Colourbox.de Nowadays, compressed audio formats are the standard solution for listening to music on the go. The most well-known of them all is mp3, which revolutionised how we listen to music in the late 1990s. The idea and the initial groundwork on the road to audio coding originated at FAU. The specific format was then developed in close collaboration with the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits (IIS) in Erlangen. The researchers who made a key contribution to the invention are all FAU alumni, and most of them studied electrical engineering. Antipyrine (also known as phenazone) Image: Colourbox.de Collaboration between chemistry and pharmacology reached its first high point in 1884: two FAU professors and a doctoral researcher succeeded in developing the first fully synthetic medicinal drug in Erlangen. Antipyrine was successfully tested on malaria patients in Italy, and replaced quinine as the most popular painkiller and antipyretic in the following years. \\u200b The beginnings of market research Image: Colourbox.de A stylish (and expensive) new mobile phone is not only an excellent communication device, it is also a status symbol. Market researchers differentiate in cases such as this between core benefits and additional benefits. The economist Wilhelm Vershofen published his ‘Nürnberger Nutzenleiter’ in 1940, representing how consumers view the benefits of consumer goods. The researcher is considered one of the founding fathers of modern market research in Germany, and was a professor at the Nuremberg Commercial College (the fore-runner to today’s School of Business, Economics and Society at FAU) from 1923. \\u200b Test-tube baby image: Colourbox.de Admittedly: The first test-tube baby was born in the UK. However, the first in-vitro baby in Germany was born at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Universitätsklinikum Erlangen in 1982. The expert in reproductive medicine Prof. Siegfried Trotnow and the biologist Tatjana Kniewald took a leading role in the research. A few years later, the researchers from Erlangen successfully reached two further milestones: In 1986 the birth of the first baby from a frozen embryo and one year later from a frozen egg cell. This was only possible after a considerable amount of work had gone into optimising the cooling processes. \\u200b Computed tomography Image: Colourbox.de Computed tomography has a long history. A number of inventions, innovations and developments have brought the technology to where it is today. In 1917, Johann Radon laid the mathematical foundation with the radon transformation. One of the positions he held was as a professor at FAU. Another researcher at FAU brought computed tomography a significant step forward. The physicist Willi A. Kalender developed spiral volumetric computed tomography which makes continual rotation possible. Future-oriented work has a long history in the laboratories and scientific and academic institutions at FAU. Which innovations will it lead to? There are some exciting developments to look forward to. A look at future innovations to be expected from FAU LOHC Prof. Dr. Peter Wasserscheid (Image: FAU/Kurt Fuchs) One important consideration when transitioning to renewable energy is the question of how to store energy. The LOHC technology developed by scientists such as FAU professor Peter Wasserscheid has a crucial contribution to make. This technology allows hydrogen to be bound to a non-explosive and non-toxic liquid, meaning that it can be used to store renewable energy without incurring losses. LOHC can also be used as fuel for ships, trains, HGVs and buses. \\u200b Tissue from a 3D printer Image: FAU/Raymund Horch The Department of Plastic and Hand Surgery at Universitätsklinikum Erlangen has been researching artificial replacement tissues (tissue engineering) and regenerative medicine for years now. Special 3D printers can be used to arrange and place materials in a certain pattern. In the long term, tissue from 3D printers has great potential. Biofabrication could replace animal testing in fundamental research, for example, and be used to engineer replacement tissue in future, for example for cancer patients or accident victims. \\u200b Software for space research Image: IRAP-OMP The X-ray integral field unit (X-IFU) on board ATHENA (Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics), a European Space Agency (ESA) space observatory, will one day be able to observe areas of energy in space. FAU has made a significant contribution to this research: Special software developed by FAU can be used to simulate the missions. This allows devices to be fine-tuned and improved before they are actually launched into space. The telescope is due to start its research in space in the 2030s. \\u200b Europe’s time machine Image: Notch Communications FAU is working in a large European project together with more than 30 other institutions – big data, digitalisation and artificial intelligence are to be used to record the social, geographical and cultural development of Europe in the Time Machine project . The project requires close collaboration between experts in archaeology, history and computer science. It is hoped that digitally processing Europe’s cultural heritage in this way should lead to new services and products in education, the creative industry, policy-making, tourism, intelligent cities and environmental modelling. \\u200b Intellectual property (IP) policy of FAU Inventions and patents Contact Press Office Intranet What to do in an emergency Reporting errors Imprint Privacy Accessibility Instagram TikTok Twitter Mastodon Bluesky YouTube Facebook Xing LinkedIn FAU Community Up'),\n",

FAU - Moving Knowledge Founded in 1743, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) is now one of the largest research universities in Germany with 38,299 students. The five faculties cover the entire spectrum of modern academic disciplines – from humanities, social sciences and theology to medicine, law, economics, sciences and engineering. One of FAU’s defining features is its commitment to interdisciplinary teaching and research, which frequently go beyond the boundaries of individual subjects. Campus locations at FAU FAU is based in three cities – Erlangen, Fürth and Nuremberg. Each of the FAU campuses is closely connected to the social and economic pulse of these cities. Studying and city life at FAU goes hand in hand. So much so, that it’s hard to tell city and campus life apart. Nuremberg Nuremberg is a modern metropolitan city, there is always something going on: theater and concerts on both larger and smaller stages, film and music festivals, cultural events such as the Blaue Nacht, motor sport events or the largest flea market in Germany, the Trempelmarkt. FAU Fürth campus Fürth is one of the very few German cities allowed to use the title ‘city of science’. However, Fürth is not only a key location for research and a good place to work, it is also a great place to live. Many FAU students make the most of the excellent public transport connections and choose to live i... Erlangen Erlangen is Bavaria’s smallest city Not only that, it is also the perfect university town: lecture halls, seminar rooms, libraries and cafeterias are never far away, the students contribute to the town’s special flair and there is always something going on.

Therefore, a very good knowledge of German (at about the Level C1/C2 ) is essential for successfully completing a degree programme at our University. Students require the following language skills and proof of proficiency: German language skills for Bachelor’s and State Examination degree programmes German language skills for Bachelor’s and State Examination degree programmes Before registering for nearly all undergraduate Bachelor’s and State Examination degree programmes, students are expected to have a very good command of German. More specific information on accepted proof of language proficiency is given below. The only programmes for which a knowledge of German is not required are the Bachelor’s degree programmes that are taught entirely in English : Autonomy Technologies (B.Sc.), Clean Energy Processes (B.Sc.), International Business Studies (B.Sc.) and International Economic Studies (B.Sc.). German language skills for Master’s degree programmes German language skills for Master’s degree programmes The level of German required for applying and/or enrolling for Master’s degree programmes varies greatly. Our information sheet on Master’s degree programmes (in German) gives an overview of the level of German required in each case. FAU offers a number of international Master’s degree programmes for which no German or only a very low level of German is required. An overview of degree programmes taught in English is included on the page on international degree programmes . Accepted proof of language skills Accepted proof of language skills The following certificates are accepted as proof of language ability when enrolling at FAU: DSH: Deutsche Sprachprüfung für den Hochschulzugang ausländischer Studienbewerber (German language university entrance examination for international students). The results of the DSH examination are divided into three levels, with level 2 considered proof of sufficient proficiency in German for all degree programmes. 1, 2 Test Deutsch als Fremdsprache (TestDaF) – a test that is offered worldwide. Serves as proof of sufficient proficiency in German if at least level 4 is reached in each of the four parts of the examination. You may have level 3 once in the TestDaF examination. However, if this is the case, you must compensate for this with level 5 in at least one part of the examination. For programs at the Faculty of Engineering you will need at least level 4 in each of the four parts of the examination. 1, 2 Goethe-Zertifikat C2 German part of the assessment examination (Feststellungsprüfung) at a German Studienkolleg. This examination also counts as proof of sufficient German language proficiency for all degree programmes. Österreichisches Sprachdiplom C2 (ÖSD C2) Deutsches Sprachdiplom of the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs level II (DSD II) , if at least level B2 is obtained in all parts of the examination Deutsche Sprachprüfung II of the Sprachen- und Dolmetscher-Institut München telc Deutsch C1 Hochschule telc Deutsch C2 For more information on these examinations please see http://www.sprachnachweis.de . 1 For degree programmes at the Faculty of Sciences, it is sufficient if applicants have DSH 1 (oral) / DSH 2 (written) or TestDaF with level 4 in three parts of the examination and no more than one part of the examination at level 3. 2 Exception Electromobility – ACES (MSc) : DSH-2 must be passed with at least 74 % of the possible points in the written and oral parts. For TestDaF, at least 4 points must be attained in each area and 5 points in at least one of the areas (subject to approval). Exemption from obligation to prove proficiency in German Exemption from obligation to prove proficiency in German An exemption from the obligation to submit proof of language proficiency may only be granted by the head of the German Department at the Language Centre, Dr. Frank Mielke after you have been admitted to a degree programme . This is usually only possible for applicants whose native language is German. A degree in German studies does not entitle an applicant to exemption from the DSH examination. Taking the DSH examination before starting to study If you cannot provide proof of proficiency as stipulated above, you can still apply to study if you have a sound knowledge of German (level B2) . If you are admitted to the degree programme you have applied to, you have to take the DSH examination immediately before starting to study and obtain the results required in order to be able to start studying. Requirements for taking the DSH examination Requirements for taking the DSH examination In order to sit the DSH examination you must prove German language proficiency of at least level B2 according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and submit evidence of having attended additional German language courses. The following certificates are accepted as proof: Goethe-Zertifikat B2 or higher telc certificate B2 or higher onDaF/onSET certificate B2 or higher ÖSD-Zertifikat B2 or higher TestDaF score of 12 points or higher (no results below level 3) UNIcert II or UNIcert III DSH 1 You will receive an invitation to the DSH examination at FAU together with your admissions letter; this examination will take place immediately before the start of the semester (late March/early April for the summer semester and late September/early October for the winter semester). If you have applied directly to FAU to study medicine, medicine in Erlangen/Bayreuth, dentistry or pharmacy, you cannot take the DSH examination just before you start to study. In these instances, the proof of proficiency in German (DSH 2 or equivalent, see ‘Accepted proof of language skills’) required for enrolment has to be submitted together with your application for a place on the degree programme. The only exception to this rule is applicants who have to apply for these degree programmes via the Stiftung für Hochschulzulassung (Foundation for University Admissions). You can visit our website about application to find out whether this applies to you. DSH preparation courses DSH preparation courses Before the DSH examination at FAU, we offer an intensive course which is structured to prepare students for the form and content of the examination. The course costs 120 euros (including 5 euros material costs). The examination is subject to an additional fee of 80 euros. You will receive the application form for the German examination and the preparatory course together with your admissions letter. The Goethe-Institut offers an online language course to prepare for German language examinations (DSH or TestDaF). For more information visit www.goethe.com . A further online German course is offered by DUO. For more information visit www.uni-deutsch.com . German course preparing for studies Provided you already have a sound knowledge of German ( Level A2 ), you can attend a German course at the FAU Language Centre specially tailored to prepare students for studying in Germany and the relevant German language examination.

The following certificates are accepted as proof: Goethe-Zertifikat A2 or higher telc certificate A2 or higher onDaF/onSET certificate A2 or higher ÖSD-Zertifikat A2 or higher At least level A2 must be achieved in each part of the examination for these certificates. Applicants who intend to enrol in a Master’s degree programme after the German course must have completed their Bachelor’s degree and submit their certificate when applying for the German course. Obligatory placement test before course starts Obligatory placement test before course starts A placement test will take place at the University’s Language Centre before the courses begin (early April for the summer semester and early October for the winter semester).

As a university which offers the entire spectrum of academic disciplines, and true to its motto ‘Knowledge in motion’, FAU offers an outstanding environment for strong interdisciplinary networking. With the FAUconnect dialogue platform, researchers have a tool for initiating and further developing their interdisciplinary research projects. The aim of the FAUconnect dialogue platform is to systematically develop forward-looking areas of research at FAU that are relevant to its strategy. The process provides fresh impetus for new innovative research networks and allows promising initiatives to be identified and supported from an early stage. The ultimate goal is to increase the acquisition of third-party funding from renowned external funding programmes to strengthen FAU’s competitiveness. Format Space for networking and creativity. This is where tomorrow’s ideas come to life (Image: Larisa Zaburdaeva). FAUconnect offers various needs-based formats that are oriented towards the individual aims of a project. The range of formats on offer include everything from small interactive workshops in Erlangen to retreats lasting a day and a half at the Fraunhofer research campus in Waischenfeld. Participants are encouraged to look beyond the boundaries of their own academic fields and discover exciting areas for research and new ways of collaborating. Exchanging ideas with the Executive Board about the strategic focus of the project is also a vital part of the programme. The programme is devised individually for each group, depending on the participants and the issues to be discussed. If required, the workshops are professionally moderated, which helps to cluster and visualise ideas. FAUconnect will not be taking place in its usual form due to the coronavirus pandemic. Online solutions will be offered instead. Funding Funding amounts to 50% of the actual costs for carrying out FAUconnect (up to a maximum of 5000 euros per project). Eligibility Applications may be submitted by all FAU professors, particularly well-qualified lecturers (Privatdozenten/innen), heads of junior research groups and postdoctoral candidates.

Each of the faculties is involved in several of FAU’s Key Research Priorities and they have also established their own interdisciplinary Research Focus Areas, which often cover subjects within several different departments. Faculty of Humanities, Social Sciences, and Theology Faculty of Humanities, Social Sciences, and Theology The Faculty of Humanities, Social Sciences, and Theology offers a comprehensive list of disciplines within the subject areas of humanities and social sciences. Its research and teaching cover a wide selection of topics from various periods and areas which are divided into eight Research Focus Areas, each of which involves elements from the key themes of culture, language and region. With around 50 different disciplines from the humanities, social sciences, economics, education sciences and theology, the Faculty of Humanities, Social Sciences, and Theology is a rich source of both historical and contemporary cultural knowledge. The Faculty offers a wide range of degree programmes in the spirit of universitas litterarum, including part-time degree programmes and continuing professional development Master’s degree programmes which are especially suitable for working professionals. It is also home to the teaching degrees (Lehramt) for all types of schools and a wide range of subjects. Many of its lectures and seminars are also open to guest students and mature students. The Faculty is involved in many research institutions, including 5 central institutes, 12 interdisciplinary centres and a range of institutions supported by third-party funding, exchanging both expertise and staff. It also has many collections of historical and archaeological importance, such as the Prehistory and Ancient History Collection, the Antique and Classical Collection and the School History Collection. Faculty of Humanities, Social Sciences, and Theology Faculty of Business, Economics, and Law Faculty of Business, Economics, and Law The Faculty of Business, Economics, and Law is subdivided into the School of Law in Erlangen and the School of Business and Economics and Society in Nuremberg. It contributes to FAU’s research profile through its research and centres which are a part of the Major Research Area ‘Cohesion – Transformation – Innovation in Law and Economics’ which also involves the Faculty of Humanities, Social Sciences, and Theology. School of Law Since it was founded it 1743, the School of Law (in German) has made a significant contribution to Erlangen’s reputation as a key location for legal knowledge and teaching. It maintains close contact with many legal bodies and professionals and companies in the region which is beneficial for its students and enriches its teaching. The School believes in a practical focus, teaching core skills and professional development, all of which are strengthened by the Institute of Notary Law and Legal Practice and an active alumni network. All members of the School are also able to benefit from its global academic network. School of Business, Economics and Society The School of Business, Economics and Society is one of the most well-known in Germany and is very strong in research. More than 6,000 students from many different countries are currently studying in 21 innovative degree programmes, obtaining excellent theoretical and practical skills preparing them for careers in business, public organisations and research. Top research and teaching of international renown, internationality, a strong practical focus, outstanding networks with the business world and consistent quality assurance are the success factors of the School of Business and Economics. Faculty of Business, Economics, and Law Faculty of Medicine Faculty of Medicine The Faculty of Medicine places great importance on the links between research, teaching and healthcare, allowing it to quickly put research findings into practice to benefit patients and strengthen medical training. The Faculty’s Research Focus Areas – immunology and infection research, renal and cardiovascular research, neuroscience (including pain and eye research) and tumour research – are tied together by its expertise in molecular medicine, clinical trials and medical engineering. The objective is to ensure that research data can be transferred quickly to clinical practice. This is known as translational research. One of the Faculty’s most promising projects is the Leading-Edge Cluster ‘Medical Valley (EMN)’, funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). In the area of immunology and infection research, FAU is the national leader in terms of DFG funding. Alongside traditional degree programmes in human medicine and dentistry, the Faculty of Medicine also offers a degree programme in molecular medicine, which was the first of its kind in Germany. The Medical Process Management degree programme was added in the winter semester 2008/09 and is currently the only one of its kind in the country. The Faculty of Medicine also began offering a degree programme in speech therapy two years ago, creating a model degree programme for a subject usually studied as a vocational qualification. The Faculty is a leader in the area of general medicine and was the first Bavarian university to establish a chair in this subject in the winter semester 2013. Its goal is to encourage more students to specialise in general medicine to help counteract the lack of general practitioners in rural areas. Faculty of Medicine Faculty of Sciences Faculty of Sciences The Faculty of Sciences at FAU is one of the best in Germany. It is home to the departments of Mathematics, Physics, Biology, Chemistry and Pharmacy, and Geography and Geology, which regularly appear towards the top of a variety of rankings, and its researchers have already won many prestigious prizes and awards. The Faculty carries out both fundamental and applied research. This research is highly interdisciplinary, involving not only researchers from the Faculty’s departments but also experts from the Faculties of Medicine and Engineering, as well as other national and international institutions. The Faculty is involved in six of the University’s eight Major Research Areas and has also established its own Research Focus Areas which cover a wide range of topics, from communication and signalling to molecular materials and geodynamics, geomaterials and georesources, representation theory, astroparticle physics and optics. Its students receive an outstanding education in a variety of degree programmes which cover all of the key scientific disciplines, with twelve Bachelor’s and Master’s degree programmes and teaching degrees (Lehramt) for the subjects biology, chemistry, geography, mathematics and physics. The Faculty ensures a close interlinking of research and teaching, allowing new knowledge to be passed directly on to its students. At the same time, students are given intensive support with their final theses which are highly research-based and contribute to the research progress. The Faculty of Sciences also runs the Bavarian elite degree programme ‘Physics Advanced’. It offers nine courses for talented school students in years 11 to 13. Faculty of Sciences Faculty of Engineering Faculty of Engineering The Faculty of Engineering was founded in 1966, making FAU the first traditional university in Germany to offer degree programmes in engineering. Since then, the Faculty of Engineering has earned itself an outstanding reputation, both at home and abroad. This is reflected in the number of students at the Faculty, which broke the 10,000 mark in the winter semester 2013/14. The Faculty consists of six departments: Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Engineering, Chemical and Biological Engineering, Electrical, Electronic and Communication Engineering, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science. It is based on the FAU Campus South and also has facilities in Nuremberg and Fürth. The Faculty of Engineering addresses fundamental research and also investigates areas which are of commercial and technological interest. Its Research Focus Areas are: new materials and processes, life science engineering and medical engineering, modelling and simulation, energy technology and mobility, optical technologies, information and communication technology, and micro- and nanotechnology. These areas involve a considerable amount of interdisciplinary dialogue between various subjects and institutions. Some of the outstanding projects at the Faculty of Engineering include the Cluster of Excellence ‘Engineering of Advanced Materials’ and the Erlangen Graduate School in Advanced Optical Technologies. The Faculty currently offers more than 20 Bachelor’s and Master’s degree programmes. In addition to traditional subjects such as chemical and biological engineering, electrical, electronic and communication engineering, computer science, mechanical engineering and materials science and engineering, it also runs a variety of interdisciplinary degree programmes in subjects such as nanotechnology and life science engineering. These degree programmes involve a great deal of collaboration with the Faculty of Sciences, the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Business, Economics, and Law. Faculty of Engineering Deans – the heads of the Faculties The dean is the managing director of a faculty or school. The dean makes decisions about staff and finance, signs Habilitation and doctoral degree certificates and awards them at public ceremonies. A dean’s teaching obligations are reduced to ensure that they can fulfil their managerial obligations in an appropriate manner. The dean is elected by the Faculty Council or the School Council for a term of two to four years. The dean’s deputy is the vice dean (or several vice deans). In addition, there is a special representative for academic teaching, the dean of studies.

Based on the research priority “Engineering for Smart Cities”, the Nuremberg Campus of Technology (NCT) has established the following six fields of research which will be represented by six chairs at FAU, six professorships at THN and additional working groups at the two institutions: Automation technology (resource-efficient production) Energy and storage technology Intelligent transport planning (urban technologies) Construction and the environment (environment, raw materials, recycling) Technology, economy and society Safety engineering On the basis of the research results and approaches used by FAU’s Faculty of Engineering and THN’s existing expertise, partnerships will be set up with other research institutions in the region to work together to create new fields in engineering research and new teaching methods. Engineering for Smart Cities examines the current development of Nuremberg and the surrounding area as a center for industry and links research activities at the NCT to the fields of expertise identified by the Nuremberg Metropolitan Region and the research priorities of companies in the area. The particular significance of cities as a place to live is highlighted by the fact that, as of the beginning of the 21st century, more than half of the world’s population now live in cities. This means that urban technologies and green development present particular opportunities and challenges for research and industry that promise to allow us to gain new knowledge and develop strategies for future markets.

A network for all members, alumni and friends of FAU Register free of charge in the FAU Community Hugely significant results for immunotherapy Immune cells, in particular T cells, must be trained to recognize cancer cells and target them specifically. A team led by FAU physicist Prof. Dr. Julio Vera-González is working together with researchers from Erlangen, Amsterdam and Rostock to investigate how this can succeed. A treatment for metastasis? A treatment for metastatic cancer – researchers at FAU, the University of Innsbruck, the MIT and Universität Würzburg have now come a major step closer to this ambitious goal. When quantum physics takes the bar by storm FAU researcher Ludwig Nützel combines the traditional card game of Schafkopf and quantum physics. He has now spiced the game up a little with his new version that introduces elements from the field of quantum physics into the trick-taking game. Radiotherapy vs. the immune system As part of our innate immune system, the complement system plays a role in destroying tumor cells. Paradoxically however, an activated complement system can also also promote the growth and formation of metastases in certain types of tumors such as sarcomas. How radiotherapy influences the complement system is now the subject of research being carried out by a consortium that researcher Dr. Michael Rückert is a member of. World’s first CAR-T cell therapy for a child with lupus “One year after the treatment, I feel as good as I did before my diagnosis, except for a few colds,” says Uresa A. today. In June 2023, Uresa received CAR-T cells at Universitätsklinikum Erlangen as a last resort to slow down systemic lupus erythematosus.

FAU offers the long-term perspective of a permanent appointment to a full (W3) professorship if the requirements of the tenure evaluation are met. The professorship comprises a joint appointment with the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS and is linked to a managerial position at the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS. In the first five years, the appointment will be on the basis of the “Berlin model”. Once the professor has been appointed to a permanent position as a public servant, the managerial position at the Fraunhofer IIS will be conducted as a secondary occupation following the “Karlsruhe model”. We seek to appoint a leading expert with an internationally visible profile in research and teaching. The professor will be expected to partake in interdisciplinary collaboration with other departments at FAU, as well as teaching in the degree programs offered by the EEI Department and associated degree programs at the Faculty of Engineering. In particular, the professor will be expected to take on responsibility for existing compulsory lectures such as Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering II and relevant laboratory courses as of the time the appointment is made permanent. Candidates should have an excellent track record in one or several of the following key research priorities and have acquired relevant project and/or industrial experience: Robust mixed-signal SoC architectures Design methodology for high performance mixed signal circuits Power efficient on-chip and inter-chip interconnections Low power design methodology Safety and security methodology for developing reliable integrated systems Chip design methods for CMOS Chip design and implementation of AI accelerators (particularly special neuromorphic chips) Successful candidates should demonstrate an excellent academic track record in research and teaching at the highest international standards. They should have substantial research experience abroad and/or international cooperations as well as experience in managing research projects and in raising third-party funding. A university degree and an outstanding doctoral degree as well as a passion for education and relevant teaching experience are prerequisites. Candidates who are able and willing to teach in both English and German are preferred. The position also requires additional postdoctoral qualifications. These should be in the form of a habilitation (postdoctoral thesis) or equivalent academic qualifications. These qualifications may also have been achieved in a non-university context or through a junior faculty position (for example as Assistant Professor). The successful candidate should demonstrate academic leadership, the ability to support early career researchers and to drive FAU’s strategic agenda. FAU pursues a policy of intense student mentoring and therefore expects its teaching staff to be present during lecture periods. FAU offers an outstandingly productive research environment as well as a passionate and multi-disciplinary scholarly community within a vibrant institutional network. In its pursuit of academic excellence, FAU is committed to equality of opportunity and to a proactive and inclusive approach, which supports and encourages all under-represented groups, promotes an inclusive culture and values diversity. FAU is a family-friendly employer and responsive to the needs of dual career couples.

Many things we take for granted today were either invented by scientists at FAU or would not have been possible without their initial research: the MP3 format, computer tomography, the first synthetic painkiller Antipyrine, endoscopy or the hydrogen carrier LOHC are just a few of the many examples. Patent management Erlangen is known as a patent metropolis and city of inventors . Patents come from various different areas such as robotics, medical engineering, coatings and tissue engineering. On average, research at FAU leads to more than 100 inventions and more than 70 patents being registered in any given year. Since the year 2000, more than 180 science and technology-based spin-offs have been established. Do you have an invention or do you want to apply for a patent? FAU’s patent management team supports inventors during the entire process from registering an invention, to applying for a patent and conducting the necessary checks, to protecting intellectual property until it is licensed or sold and organizing the associated contracts.

The options available depend on your subject and your research project. Whichever way you choose, you will have access to our range of seminars and events, our administrative support and our assistance with networking. Or are you unsure yet whether you actually want to complete a doctoral degree? We are happy to advise you during a consultation. If you would like an in-depth consultation, please contact us in advance to arrange an appointment. To ensure that doctoral degrees are completed successfully it is important that doctoral candidates and their supervisors are aware of their rights and responsibilities. The check list Good practice for carrying out and supervising doctoral degrees is used as a guideline. It provides the basis for the initial meeting between the doctoral candidate and their supervisor that must be held at the start of the process. Different ways to obtain a doctoral degree at FAU Individual doctoral degree Individual doctoral degree If you want to work on an individual doctoral degree you must find your own supervisor and work on your research project largely independently. Depending on your subject you may work alone or with other researchers. If you choose an individual doctoral degree, the length of time taken to complete it depends on your planning – or the duration of your contract. It usually takes three to five years. Structured doctoral programmes Structured doctoral programmes You can also complete a doctoral degree as part of one of FAU’s structured doctoral programmes. The programmes include a complementary curriculum that is often interdisciplinary and usually aim to enable participants to gain soft skills and additional qualifications. The intense, systematic supervision provided in these programmes should usually enable you to complete your doctoral degree within three to four years. Doctoral candidates taking part in structured doctoral programmes also have main supervisors. Doctoral candidates usually organise a supervisor before applying to take part in a structured doctoral programme. If you are interested in participating in one of our doctoral programmes, please apply directly to the persons responsible for the programme. An overview is available at Structured doctoral programmes . Cooperative doctoral degrees Cooperative doctoral degrees If you would like to complete a doctoral degree at a university of applied sciences, you can do this in co-operation with FAU. You will then have two supervisors, one from FAU and one from the university of applied sciences. If you are interested in pursuing this option, please contact the responsible Office of Doctoral Affairs or the head of the Graduate Centre, Dr. Christian Schmitt-Engel. Guide to cooperative doctoral degrees at FAU External doctoral degree External doctoral degree In the case of external doctoral theses, doctoral candidates do not have close ties to the Institute or Chair, and are certainly not employed there. External doctoral candidates cover their costs with paid employment outside the University. FAU provides academic supervision and is entitled to award doctoral degrees. That means you need a supervisor at FAU who supports you in your research and your external doctoral degree. If you choose to do an external doctoral degree, you are considerably less involved in work at the Chair than you would be in the case of an internal doctoral thesis. Accordingly, the supervision relationship is much more casual and is restricted to discussing the doctoral thesis. It ought to be borne in mind that allocating theses of this nature raises many questions about legal issues and processes that affect all those involved (students, companies, lecturers acting as supervisors, FAU). They are outlined in the Information sheet on allocating topics for and completing external Bachelor’s, Master’s and doctoral theses .

Therefore, a very good knowledge of German (at about the Level C1/C2 ) is essential for successfully completing a degree programme at our University. Students require the following language skills and proof of proficiency: German language skills for Bachelor’s and State Examination degree programmes German language skills for Bachelor’s and State Examination degree programmes Before registering for nearly all undergraduate Bachelor’s and State Examination degree programmes, students are expected to have a very good command of German. More specific information on accepted proof of language proficiency is given below. The only programmes for which a knowledge of German is not required are the Bachelor’s degree programmes that are taught entirely in English : Autonomy Technologies (B.Sc.), Clean Energy Processes (B.Sc.), International Business Studies (B.Sc.) and International Economic Studies (B.Sc.). German language skills for Master’s degree programmes German language skills for Master’s degree programmes The level of German required for applying and/or enrolling for Master’s degree programmes varies greatly. Our information sheet on Master’s degree programmes (in German) gives an overview of the level of German required in each case. FAU offers a number of international Master’s degree programmes for which no German or only a very low level of German is required. An overview of degree programmes taught in English is included on the page on international degree programmes . Accepted proof of language skills Accepted proof of language skills The following certificates are accepted as proof of language ability when enrolling at FAU: DSH: Deutsche Sprachprüfung für den Hochschulzugang ausländischer Studienbewerber (German language university entrance examination for international students). The results of the DSH examination are divided into three levels, with level 2 considered proof of sufficient proficiency in German for all degree programmes. 1, 2 Test Deutsch als Fremdsprache (TestDaF) – a test that is offered worldwide. Serves as proof of sufficient proficiency in German if at least level 4 is reached in each of the four parts of the examination. You may have level 3 once in the TestDaF examination. However, if this is the case, you must compensate for this with level 5 in at least one part of the examination. For programs at the Faculty of Engineering you will need at least level 4 in each of the four parts of the examination. 1, 2 Goethe-Zertifikat C2 German part of the assessment examination (Feststellungsprüfung) at a German Studienkolleg. This examination also counts as proof of sufficient German language proficiency for all degree programmes. Österreichisches Sprachdiplom C2 (ÖSD C2) Deutsches Sprachdiplom of the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs level II (DSD II) , if at least level B2 is obtained in all parts of the examination Deutsche Sprachprüfung II of the Sprachen- und Dolmetscher-Institut München telc Deutsch C1 Hochschule telc Deutsch C2 For more information on these examinations please see http://www.sprachnachweis.de . 1 For degree programmes at the Faculty of Sciences, it is sufficient if applicants have DSH 1 (oral) / DSH 2 (written) or TestDaF with level 4 in three parts of the examination and no more than one part of the examination at level 3. 2 Exception Electromobility – ACES (MSc) : DSH-2 must be passed with at least 74 % of the possible points in the written and oral parts. For TestDaF, at least 4 points must be attained in each area and 5 points in at least one of the areas (subject to approval). Exemption from obligation to prove proficiency in German Exemption from obligation to prove proficiency in German An exemption from the obligation to submit proof of language proficiency may only be granted by the head of the German Department at the Language Centre, Dr. Frank Mielke after you have been admitted to a degree programme . This is usually only possible for applicants whose native language is German. A degree in German studies does not entitle an applicant to exemption from the DSH examination. Taking the DSH examination before starting to study If you cannot provide proof of proficiency as stipulated above, you can still apply to study if you have a sound knowledge of German (level B2) . If you are admitted to the degree programme you have applied to, you have to take the DSH examination immediately before starting to study and obtain the results required in order to be able to start studying. Requirements for taking the DSH examination Requirements for taking the DSH examination In order to sit the DSH examination you must prove German language proficiency of at least level B2 according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and submit evidence of having attended additional German language courses. The following certificates are accepted as proof: Goethe-Zertifikat B2 or higher telc certificate B2 or higher onDaF/onSET certificate B2 or higher ÖSD-Zertifikat B2 or higher TestDaF score of 12 points or higher (no results below level 3) UNIcert II or UNIcert III DSH 1 You will receive an invitation to the DSH examination at FAU together with your admissions letter; this examination will take place immediately before the start of the semester (late March/early April for the summer semester and late September/early October for the winter semester). If you have applied directly to FAU to study medicine, medicine in Erlangen/Bayreuth, dentistry or pharmacy, you cannot take the DSH examination just before you start to study. In these instances, the proof of proficiency in German (DSH 2 or equivalent, see ‘Accepted proof of language skills’) required for enrolment has to be submitted together with your application for a place on the degree programme. The only exception to this rule is applicants who have to apply for these degree programmes via the Stiftung für Hochschulzulassung (Foundation for University Admissions). You can visit our website about application to find out whether this applies to you. DSH preparation courses DSH preparation courses Before the DSH examination at FAU, we offer an intensive course which is structured to prepare students for the form and content of the examination.

Making machines think! The international Master’s program in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is based on a solid foundation and education in the field of Computer Science. The program consists of three main pillars: symbolic AI (such as Expert Systems and Logical Calculi), subsymbolic AI (such as Deep and Machine Learning) and AI systems and applications . The degree course offers a broad variety of topics and specializations. The wide range of applications and research groups in the Department of Computer Science provides broad opportunities for “hands-on” project work and practical sessions. In contrast to Data Science oriented programs, AI focuses on the constructive modelling and implementation of algorithms, data structures, neural networks and their respective applications. Degree Master of Science Duration of studies in semester 4 Start of degree program Summer semester, Winter semester Study location Erlangen Number of students 250-600 Subject group Engineering sciences Special ways to study International degree program, Part-time degree program Teaching language completely in English Admission Requirements Qualification assessment Apply now Tips for application Tips for internationals What is the degree program about? The desired goal that is to be achieved by the study of Artificial Intelligence at the Faculty of Engineering is the education of thoroughly skilled computer scientists with a specifically formed profile. Using the methodical skills and knowledge acquired during their education, graduates should be able to solve engineering tasks which are located at any of the intersections of the areas of computer science, applied mathematics, and an engineering discipline independently and responsibly. They should also be able to develop new perspectives on their field of activity and to judge applied tools and methodologies critically. Goals of the Master’s Program Demand Graduates of our Master’s program have excellent job prospects. During your studies, subjects you were first introduced to during your qualifying degree can be given more breadth and depth, according to your individual goals and preferences. Students are introduced to current topics of academic or industrial research. A successfully completed Master’s degree will be acknowledged as a prerequisite for being admitted to doctoral programs at German universities. Actual admission to a doctoral program, however, also requires proof of high research potential, as preferably demonstrated by an outstanding Master’s thesis. International Orientation The program complies with the internationally accepted Bachelor’s-Master’s structure. The majority of the courses are in English, thus making it attractive for foreign students who do not speak German. At the same time, German students in the program benefit from working with English as an international scientific language. That way it also becomes easier for German students to work or study abroad afterwards. The possibility of studying abroad is additionally enhanced by the program’s compatibility with the Anglo-American university system. Flexibility The integration of many different specialized fields requires a flexible organization of study plans. Following the Anglo-American pattern, students are encouraged to choose an individualized study plan from a wide selection of fields to suit their individual interests. The program is modular, as defined by the examination regulations (Prüfungsordnung). In order to ensure optimal support students are assisted by special academic advisors (Studienberater) for the AI program. Design and structure The program encompasses 120 ECTS credits, usually split over four semesters at a rate of 30 ECTS credits per semester. This section will give some further detail. Please also refer to the official study regulations, especially the FPO, and the standard degree program structure. Electives [50 ECTS]: The elective courses in this Master’s program are geared towards introducing students to academic research around artificial intelligence and its methodologies as well as offering every student the opportunity to shape their profile specifically towards their talents and interests. The electives are centered around the three central pillars of the AI Master’s program: Symbolic AI Subsymbolic AI AI Systems and Applications Students will have to take a total of 50 ECTS credits worth of elective courses, with no less than 10 of them in each of the central pillars. Which courses are available for each of these tracks is announced on a semester-by-semester basis in the module catalog. Projects [10 + 10 ECTS]: The two required 10 ECTS projects are intended to hone and put to the test students’ acquired technical knowledge, research ability and self-organization skills. They will typically be completed in the context of a work group related to artificial intelligence and will require the students to independently tackle a more complex problem or question. Both projects have to be associated with one of the central pillars discussed above and cannot both be associated with the same pillar. Each project is planned to take approximately 300 hours over six months. Seminar [5 ECTS]: The seminar will allow students to connect with a topic complex of their choice, conduct research and interact with academic information, and present their findings to a relevant audience. It is intended to account for 5 ECTS credits and can be completed in a group. Minor [15 ECTS]: For this module, students will chose 15 ECTS credits worth of courses that have a practical or topical connection to artificial intelligence (but are not already included in the electives discussed above). The goal is to work on connecting the gained knowledge to a broad array of subjects that interface with artificial intelligence and may form the basis for applications in future employment. Master’s Thesis [30 ECTS]: The Master’s thesis can be registered at the Examinations Office as soon as the student has successfully collected 70 ECTS credits. It has an extent of around 900 hours and has to be completed within six months after registration. The topic of the thesis must be related to subjects studied by the student during the program. A special thesis supervisor is usually assigned to each student. The thesis may involve regular meetings with the thesis supervisor and also participation in a larger research group. It needs to be written in English. An oral presentation of the results lasting about 30 minutes and a consecutive discussion are obligatory.

Social duty With its strength in both fundamental research and application-oriented research, FAU has a significant contribution to make towards driving scientific and academic progress in key areas of society. FAU sees it as its duty to make this contribution, based on the principle of the freedom of teaching and research. Image: AMJ Gremsdorf As a university which offers the entire spectrum of academic disciplines, FAU generates knowledge in a wide range of disciplines covering the humanities, social sciences, economics, law, medicine, natural sciences and engineering. FAU strives to promote the dissemination of findings, ideas, developments and technology from all research areas, thereby contributing to scientific and academic progress. Publishing results in scientific and academic publications takes precedence over all other transfer activities. FAU also contributes to the common good of society by constantly delivering knowledge and technology which can be used as the basis for designing specific innovations. Technology transfer in this context does not only refer to invention and patent management but also to ongoing scientific training and advice on spin-offs or other such activities. Claim to exploitation Claim to exploitation Research findings generated at FAU can serve as the basis for developing innovative products, technologies and services. This means that the research findings have an inherent economic value going beyond the relevant findings themselves. This value can only be generated, however, by developing a product on the basis of the research. FAU conducts active invention and patent management in order to ensure that this value can be used for the benefit the University. FAU is aware that the process of developing a product fit for the market can only succeed in collaboration with extramural partners and that these partners will have to make further investments along the way. In order to ensure the economic viability of such investments, mechanisms for the protection of intellectual property have to be triggered in good time. The active IP policy followed by FAU therefore helps to translate the inherent value of the IP into a financial return at the same time as creating the basis for the University to share in these financial benefits whilst representing the interests of its inventors as well as possible. FAU is also keen to involve independent inventors such as students or scholarship holders, and gives them an equal standing to inventors employed by the University when sharing out proceeds generated by the commercial exploitation of IP. In the long term, FAU aims to generate proceeds for the University within the framework of university autonomy. In addition to the legally stipulated remuneration for the inventor (30 percent of generated income), the Chair behind a successful invention will receive a separate share of the proceeds which it can use as it wishes for research and teaching purposes. Criteria for registering IP rights for exploitation Criteria for registering IP rights for exploitation When safeguarding research findings and their exploitation, FAU pays particular attention to the interests of the inventors and the University, whilst bearing legal requirements (ArbnErfG, UrhG, BayHSchG) in mind at all times. FAU recognises that it is bound by generally accepted ethical and moral constraints of science, both with regard to the implementation of research projects and to the exploitation of findings generated as a result of this research. In particular, FAU takes care to ensure that safeguarding suitable research findings and exploiting them in their capacity as IP does not interfere with the researchers’ freedom to publish. The University draws on the expertise of law firms specialising in patents for safeguarding potentially patentable research findings in order to ensure that the requirements of the various disciplines are met. Inventions created at FAU are classed as either inventions covered by contracts which are transferred to industrial partners under the terms of individual or framework contracts or free inventions not bound to any contract in which case FAU is free to decide on their commercial exploitation. Joint inventions developed in collaboration with other research institutions are also classed as independent inventions. In all instances, the patent management team at FAU is the internal service provider and initial point of contact if you are an inventor seeking advice or would like to discuss a possible patent application strategy. They should also be consulted when selecting and commissioning external patent lawyers and can provide advice on the contents, administration and performance of contractual obligations When deciding on whether to apply for intellectual property rights to an independent invention, FAU focuses not only on criteria set out in patent law but first and foremost on the economic criteria of market relevance, options for commercial exploitation and economic potential. With regard to options for exploitation, the decision to protect the IP generated by a research project is taken after considering the extent to which value has been created or is expected to be created within the academic sphere in question. Projects which have either already reached a stage in their development or which are forecast to reach a stage at which they have the potential to significantly improve the options for exploitation ought to be protected by a suitable IP strategy, even if this means FAU has to make a long-term commitment. Another point which is taken into consideration when coming to a decision is whether the invention is potentially of interest to FAU’s industrial contacts and the Network of the Bavarian Patent Alliance (as the central patent exploitation agency for Bavarian institutions of higher education). Ideally, a successful transfer into the industrial sector should take place via existing networks of inventors or via FAU’s own networks. If there are no specific contacts available for any individual project, then the very least that is expected is that possible contacts in industry are identified beforehand. Close collaboration between inventors, Chairs and the project management team or BayPAT significantly improve a project’s chances of exploitation. Know-how and copyright Know-how and copyright In addition to exploiting IP by applying for a patent or other protection rights, results available in the form of know-how or material can be exploited directly by being licensed or sold. The term ‘know-how’ can refer to items such as valuable biological material, for example hybridoma cell lines used to produce monoclonal antibodies for scientific purposes, transgenic cell lines or organisms. The results protected by copyright can be rights to texts or images, or computer software. Along the lines of the remuneration paid to inventors, FAU also provides remuneration to scientists involved in generating results protected by copyright amounting to 30 percent of net proceeds. FAU makes all research results available to society in detail and without delay in the form of academic publications, irrespective of their potential for commercial exploitation as intellectual property. Principles of exploitation Principles of exploitation When making arrangements for commercial exploitation, FAU will pay particular consideration to the benefit to society as a whole and will prioritise this over short-term financial gain. If it becomes apparent that an invention is likely to be of particular significance, the University will choose non-exclusive arrangements over an exclusive contract in order to meet its obligations to serve the common good. In cases in which it is apparent that a prospective interested party does not have any genuine intention to develop the invention further and merely intends to restrict free competition (blocking patent), FAU will choose not to conclude a contract with this interested party. Inventions in the area of military and arms technology, nuclear technology and secret communications engineering are a special case. In these instances, FAU will take a stance in each individual case after internal consultations. A statement is drawn up by the patent management team and submitted to the Executive Board which takes the decision. The inventor must refrain from publishing until a decision has been taken. Exploitation routes Exploitation routes There are various routes which can be taken to make IP available for commercial exploitation, each of which entail particular opportunities and risks. Contractual obligations vis-à-vis third parties, third-party rights and other factors relevant to the the inventions are taken into consideration accordingly. IP is transferred from FAU to the respective partners at normal market conditions applicable to the specific product environment. FAU retains in all instances a simple, indefinite right of use for research and teaching purposes. The freedom to publish remains unaffected, and legitimate interests of third parties shall be taken into consideration accordingly. IP rights belonging to FAU can be exploited via a licence or purchase contract. When arranging exploitation, the fair market value of the IP rights is taken as the basis for agreeing conditions, whereby FAU will strive to obtain a long-term participation in the invention’s commercial success, which is also in the interests of its inventors. In addition, the financial expenditure for the patent application procedure should be re-financed with the proceedings from a patent sale or licence agreement. Spin-off based on the invention Spin-off based on the invention FAU explicitly encourages the establishment of companies (spin-offs or start-ups) based on the research results in order to drive their implementation into products ready for the market and thereby create jobs. Future-oriented, technology-based spin-offs and their financing by investors are based mainly on inventions and property rights. In particular, FAU will choose the route of transferring IPR in return for participation as a minority shareholder in order to get the best possible return from the IPR assets. Alternatively, the University will grant the right to use the IP by issuing a licence to the founding company. Within the framework of its legal possibilities, FAU will take the limited financial resources of university-based spin-offs which are just starting out into account in favour of a later participation in their success. FAU shall also stand by this principle if it becomes necessary to sell IP, for example within the context of financing rounds. Summary The autonomy of the University means that it has both the opportunity and the obligation to exploit all potential of research results in a sustainable and targeted way.

The FAU Press Office can help you will all aspects of science communication and engaging with the public. As there is increasing interest among the general population with regard to how public money is spent and what goes on at universities, researchers have a responsibility to explain their work and its benefits to the general public using appropriate methods and to enter into dialogue with them. This is often reflected in the funding agreements of third-party funding providers such as the DFG, which stipulate that research findings must be presented to the public effectively. Furthermore, public discussion always feeds back into research and makes it possible to view it from a different angle. The Press Office is happy to help you with the following topics: Press releases Press releases Have you just been awarded funding for a large research project or received a prize for your work? Are you about to publish an important paper or book or is something exciting happening at your institute (such as a teaching project or a unique partnership)? Or would you like to invite the general public to attend an event you are organising? Please contact the Press Office well in advance so that we can determine whether and how to present your news to a wide, non-specialist audience in an interesting way. It is generally not effective to issue press information after an event has already taken place or a paper has already been published. Please bear in mind that press releases should be aimed at a non-specialist audience – some facts and terminology that are self-evident to you as part of your everyday research will need to be explained, and complex concepts will need to be simplified for the general reader. The Press Office can help you do this. Please note: the aim of a press release is to make information available to the media should they wish to use it. There is no guarantee that it will be reproduced. Expert opinions Expert opinions Would you like to contribute to the debate on a current issue? Journalists often use background information that the Press Office presents in the ‘Nachgefragt’ series in which experts answer three questions. In many cases the Press Office will contact you directly because journalists are looking for an expert to answer a specific question. As the media is always under pressure to be up to date, it is important that you respond quickly – even if you decline because it is not your area of expertise or you are unavailable. If a media representative contacts you directly, the Press Office is happy to advise you on an questions you may have about their request, such as participating in a TV interview. Press conferences Press conferences Press conferences are only recommended for very important news or major conferences. The Press Office is happy to help you decide whether a press conference is appropriate for your topic. Please make sure you contact us in good time; the Press Office can then invite the media, can help you create information folders, and may be able to provide assistance in person at the event. Images, photos, illustrations Images, photos, illustrations An informative image increases the likelihood of your topic being picked up by the media. Please provide high quality images that are also suitable for printing (7cm at 300 dpi) and ensure you clarify beforehand whether the copyright holder agrees to the image being used free-of-charge for the intended purposes (e.g. online, FAU publications, social media) and that it does not infringe on the rights of any third parties.

Methods of science communication Methods of science communication Documentaries, discussions, science slams, pecha kucha, science blogs, social media, hands-on experiments, public dialogue, popular science texts, science cafés – there is a suitable method of science communication for everyone.
